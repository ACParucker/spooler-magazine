          1.0  Introduction to MyComm

            MyComm is a small, yet powerful, data communications program
          designed to enable users to access public bulletin board systems
          (BBS's) and other telecommunication services.  MyComm is designed
          to run under the PC/MS-DOS operating system using DOS version 3.3
          or higher.  MyComm has a variety of built in file transfer
          protocols including Zmodem, Xmodem, Xmodem-1K, Ymodem Batch,
          Ymodem-G Batch, SEAlink, and of course ASCII.  There are also
          slots to install up to six external file transfer protocols.

            The driving principle behind MyComm is to provide a reliable,
          powerful, and versatile communications package which is easy to
          use, and small in size.  Great care has been taken to optimize
          MyComm for operating speed and to keep the executable code size
          small so that it takes up less of your valuable disk space.
          MyComm is designed to be easy to use for both novice and
          experienced users, and employs a menu system that is friendly and
          simple to navigate through.

          MyComm features include:

          þ    A full featured communications package which is small in
               size.

          þ    Wide variety of popular file transfer protocols.

          þ    Powerful, yet easy to use "script" language.

          þ    Small code size which will run in less than 200K of RAM.

          þ    Intelligent ANSI character translation which filters out
               potentially harmful ANSI keyboard re-mapping sequences.

          þ    Intelligent DOS shell function that brings you back to the
               disk drive and directory that you started from when you
               return to MyComm.

          þ    Detection and use of the 16550 UART and FIFO buffers.

          þ    Locates program and configuration files no matter what
               directory MyComm is started from (DOS 3.0 or greater).

          þ    Support for COM ports 1 through 8.

          þ    Simple, and easy to use.  Some may even call it "fun"!

          1.1  Registration and Licensing

            MyComm is NOT Public Domain or free software.  The MyComm
          software, support files, and documentation are Copyright (c) 1992
          - 1994 Ken Dorshimer, all rights reserved.

            MyComm is being marketed under the "Shareware" concept.  You
          may use MyComm for a 30 day evaluation period to determine its
          usefulness in your particular application.  After the 30 day
          evaluation period you must register MyComm if you continue to use
          it.

            Registration is as follows:

              Send $25 (twenty five U.S. dollars drawn on a U.S. bank),
          plus $2 shipping and handling to:

               Ken Dorshimer
               P.O. Box 5143
               Belmont, Ca. 94002

            (Please send check or money order, do not send cash.  People
          who want to order MyComm from outside the U.S. should obtain a
          money order in U.S. dollars from a local bank.)

            For your convenience there is a file called ORDER.FRM which is
          an order form for MyComm.  The order form is also included in
          Appendix F of this document.  Please note that if you downloaded
          MyComm from a BBS that charges a subscription fee, obtained a
          copy of MyComm from a "shareware disk copying" service, or CD ROM
          library the registration fee for MyComm is not paid for or
          collected by those services!

            MyComm represents many, many hours of work on my part in
          research, design, coding, testing, revising, enhancing and
          writing the documentation.  Writing a piece of software like
          MyComm is not trivial.  Your registration not only gives me the
          incentive to continue producing and upgrading shareware products
          like this one, but it is the right thing to do.

            Let's face it.  $25 is not a lot to spend on a program that
          does everything MyComm does.  Comparable communications packages
          are generally much more expensive.  The Shareware market is an
          "all risk" venture for the author, while the user has everything
          to gain.  Your registration tells me that MyComm was worth
          creating, and that people like it.  I like to know that people
          appreciate the effort I put into a project, don't we all?  Enjoy
          using the MyComm software, and I'm looking forward to hearing
          from you.

            When you register MyComm I will send you the most recent
          version of MyComm and its documentation on disk (standard 3.5" or
          5.25" floppy disk, 3.5" preferred).  At this time I am not
          offering a printed manual in order to keep the cost of the
          software reasonable.  Registered users will also be offered a
          discount on future upgrades.

          Multiple registrations to the same individual or site will be
          discounted as follows:

               1  to 5    copies      -  no discount
               6  to 10   copies      -  5% discount
               11 to 25   copies      - 10% discount
               26 to 50   copies      - 20% discount
               51 to 100  copies      - 30% discount
               over 100 copies        - inquire for quote

            Inquiries for site licenses and multiple registrations of
          MyComm should be directed to the above address, or via Compuserve
          (Tm) 73113,3536.  In the case of site licenses and multiple
          registrations a maximum of five (5) diskettes will be sent with
          the order unless otherwise negotiated.



            Registered users will be granted license to use the MyComm
          software as they deem fit and within the law.  The registered
          version of MyComm may be duplicated for backup purposes only.
          MyComm is not to be used on more than one computer at a time.
          However a user may install MyComm on their computer at work and
          their computer at home providing that the two computers are not
          operated simultaneously.  Feel free to contact me regarding
          multiple registrations and site licenses.

            All users are granted a limited license to make copies of the
          unregistered "shareware" version of MyComm for the purpose of
          allowing others to try it out, and the unregistered version may
          also be uploaded to public bulletin board systems subject to the
          above restrictions as well as the following:

               þ    MyComm must be distributed in completely unmodified
                    form, including all support files and documentation.

               þ    MyComm may not be included or bundled with any other
                    product for any reason without a license from the
                    author, Ken Dorshimer.

               þ    No charge or payment may be levied or accepted for the
                    MyComm software except by the author, Ken Dorshimer.


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 4



            MyComm may not be sold or distributed through a third party
          (this includes copying services and shareware distribution
          outlets which distribute software for a copying fee) without the
          expressed written permission of the author, Ken Dorshimer.
          Shareware distribution services and bulletin boards which charge
          a fee for software distribution should contact me for written
          permission to distribute MyComm.

            The MyComm executable file(s) and documentation, both the
          "registered" and "unregistered" versions are copyrighted material
          and may not be modified or reverse engineered in any manner.  If
          you require modified or customized versions of MyComm for
          whatever reason feel free to contact the author at the address
          above.

          1.2  Disclaimer and Warranty

          Disclaimer and Warranty:

            MyComm was designed and coded on a best efforts basis in

          1.4  General System Requirements

            MyComm is designed to run under the PC/MS-DOS operating system.
          MyComm may be run either from a hard drive or a floppy drive,
          although a floppy drive is not recommended when performing file
          transfers (just too slow).  Great care has been taken to keep the
          code size small so MyComm will run with as little as 200K of main
          memory (RAM) available.  MyComm will run using a Monochrome
          Graphics Adapter (MGA), a true Hercules (Tm) monochrome card,
          EGA, and VGA.

            MyComm is designed to use modems which use the Hayes (Tm) "AT"
          command set.  Your modem should support this standard or a subset
          of it.  MyComm supports modem speeds of 300, 1200, 2400, 4800,
          9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200 baud and a wide variety of
          data bit, parity bit, and stop bit settings.


          1.5  MyComm Files

            The files included in the MyComm package are:

               þ MYCOMM.EXE  -     MyComm main executable program.

               þ MYCOMM.DOC  -     Documentation for MyComm (you're reading
                                   it now).

               þ ORDER.FRM   -     Order form for MyComm.

               þ BUGRPT.FRM  -     Form to describe any problems or
                                   bugs you may have found, or to make
                                   suggestions for future versions of
                                   MyComm.

               þ SCP_CHK.EXE -     Program to check the syntax of script
                                   file commands. See Appendix-E "MyComm
                                   Script Language" for more information.

          2.0  MyComm Installation

            MyComm is amazingly simple to install and use.  That's the
          whole idea!  The instructions in this section will have you up
          and running in no time.  Pay special attention to the information
          that should be in your CONFIG.SYS file, and the stuff about the
          COM ports.


          2.1  System Requirements

            MyComm is designed to run on IBM or compatible personal
          computers under the MS-DOS operating system.  Machines may be of
          the PC, XT, AT, 386 or above class of personal computers.

            MyComm has the following system requirements:

                þ   at least 200K of free memory (RAM).

                þ   MS-DOS version 3.0 or greater or similar "after market"
                    Disk Operating System.

                þ   Hayes compatible modem which accepts the " AT " command
                    set.

                þ   Your CONFIG.SYS file should contain the statements:

                         Device=ANSI.SYS
                         Files=40
                         Buffers=40

                    If your CONFIG.SYS file does not contain these
                    statements then you will need to modify the CONFIG.SYS
                    file.  The CONFIG.SYS file may be edited with an
                    ordinary text editor.  Simply type in a line that reads
                    "Device=ANSI.SYS", "Files=40", and one that reads
                    "Buffers=40" (without the quotes) and save the file.
                    Refer to your DOS manual if you need more information
                    on CONFIG.SYS.

          2.2  MyComm Installation Instructions

            Before you start the MyComm installation you should know which
          COM port your modem is set for.  Consult your modem manual if
          you're not sure.  Modems vary too much from one manufacturer to
          another to describe every difference in this manual.

          Step 1:   Modify your CONFIG.SYS file to make any of the required
                    changes described in section 2.1 above.

          Step 2:   Create a directory on your hard drive (or a floppy
                    drive) called "MYCOMM" and change directory into the
                    new "MYCOMM" directory.

                               Example:

                                   C:
                                   CD\
                                   MD MYCOMM
                                   CD MYCOMM

          Step 3:   Copy the MYCOMM files into this new directory.

          Step 4:   Run MyComm.  At the DOS command prompt type "MYCOMM"
                    then press the <Enter> key.

          Step 5:   MyComm will start to load.  The first time MyComm is
                    run it will tell you that it can't find the
                    "Configuration File".  It will then create a new
                    configuration file called MYCOMM.CFG.  MyComm will also
                    create an empty phone dialing list called MYCOMM.PHN.

          Step 6:   MyComm has a default COM port setting of COM Port 1.
                    If your modem is set up for COM 1 already, don't sweat
                    it.  Otherwise, MyComm will prompt you for the serial
                    port to use.  Choose the COM Port that your modem is
                    set on.  MyComm will then try to initialize the COM
                    Port.  If all goes well you should see the letters "OK"
                    on the screen under the copyright notice.  If the modem
                    doesn't appear to be responding, try repeating Step 6
                    using another COM Port (if you have more than one) or
                    see Appendix D "Troubleshooting".


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 10



                      You can see if the modem is responding correctly by
                    typing "AT" (without the quotes) and then press
                    <Enter>.  The modem should respond with "OK".  You may
                    test the phone line connection by typing "ATM1DT"
                    (again, without the quotes) then press <Enter>.  This
                    command tells the modem to turn its' speaker on, then
                    dial nothing.  You should hear a dial tone from the
                    modem speaker.  Press <Enter> again and the dial tone
                    should stop and the modem should respond with "NO
                    CARRIER".

           Step 7:  Press the <Alt> and "U" key.  This will bring up
                    MyComm's Update Configuration Menu.  Go through each of
                    the menu options and make any changes required.  The
                    remainder of this documentation describes each of the
                    MyComm options and functions.

           Step 8:  You will also need to modify the "Modem Initialization
                    String".  This is done in the "Modem Setup" screen.
                    MyComm needs to see text response codes from the modem
                    rather than numeric codes.  The general purpose
                    initialization string that MyComm uses as by default
                    is:

                         AT M1 X4 Q0 V1 S0=0 S11=50 S7=50 &C1 &D2^M

                    Broken down this means:

                    AT     - "Hi modem! I'm sending you commands now".
                    M1     - Turn on modem speaker (M0 turns it off).
                    X4     - Select highest level of responses.
                    Q0     - Always send responses.
                    V1     - Send text responses.
                    S0=0   - Do not answer the phone.
                    S11=50 - Use fast dialing speed.
                    S7=50  - Wait time for Carrier Detect in seconds.
                    &C1    - Keep Carrier Detect (CD) low until a
                             connection is made.
                    &D2    - Use RTS/CTS flow control (important on
                             high speed modems).
                    ^M     - Send Carriage Return character (MyComm
                             internal command - see also Appendix J).

          2.3  Running MyComm

            Section 3 of this document covers all the options and functions
          that MyComm offers.  There are some additional items that should
          be covered first.

            MyComm may be started in a number of ways.  Below are three
          different methods to start the MyComm program.

          Method 1: Start MyComm from the directory that you installed
                    MyComm in. For example:

                         CD\MYCOMM

                    then type "MYCOMM" and press the <Enter> key.  This
                    will start the MyComm program.

          Method 2: MyComm will also load from any directory if you have
                    set a "Path" with the DOS path command that points to
                    the directory MyComm lives in.  For example to set the
                    path type:

                         PATH=C:\MYCOMM

                    providing of course that you installed MyComm in the
                    directory C:\MYCOMM.  Just substitute the appropriate
                    path in that case.

          Method 3: You may also specify the "fully qualified" DOS path to
                    start MyComm.  For example:

                        C:\MYCOMM\MYCOMM

                   will also cause MyComm to start.

            If you have questions about the DOS Path commands or statements
          please refer to your DOS manual.

            If you are using DOS version 3.0 or higher MyComm will
          automatically find it's configuration file.  This means that
          MyComm may be started from any drive or directory on your system
          without having to always start in the MyComm directory  This will
          save you the trouble (and typing) of changing directories when
          you want to use MyComm.

            MyComm will however try to start a new phone file in the
          directory you are in unless you have included the fully qualified
          path to the phone directory file in the Setup options.  This
          allows you to keep multiple phone files in different directories
          depending on your needs.

          3.0  MyComm Screens and Menus

            MyComm has several screens and menus to allow you to change
          various options and to perform various functions.  Most screens
          and menus are brought up by pressing the <ALT> key and then a
          letter.  Pressing <F1> while in the terminal screen shows you
          Help Menu which lists all of the MyComm functions (see also
          section 3.2).


          3.1  Terminal Screen

            When MyComm is first loaded, and after the configuration file
          has been read, it defaults to the terminal screen which looks
          like this:


          MyComm <Version Information>
          Copyright (c) 1992 - 1994 Ken Dorshimer  -  All rights reserved.

          Press <F1> for Help
          Press <Alt-D> for Dial Screen


            You will see the version number, and copyright notice.

            In the terminal screen you may enter regular Hayes - AT modem
          commands, or choose one of the many MyComm functions.  The MyComm
          functions are listed in the Help Menu which is displayed when you
          press the <F1> key on your keyboard.  The MyComm functions are
          described in more detail in the following sections of this
          manual.

          3.2  Help Menu - F1

            Pressing the <F1> key brings up the MyComm Help Screen which
          looks like this:

          (NOTE: many of the MyComm screens shown in this documentation are
          smaller than actual size so that they will fit on a printed
          page.)

            Pressing <Esc> or any other key closes the MyComm Help Screen
          window.


          3.3  Chat Mode - Alt A

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "A" key brings you into the MyComm
          Chat window.  The chat screen is useful when you want to send
          text messages or "chat" interactively with someone while on-line.
          If you were not using the Chat Mode the "conversation" would
          eventually end up looking like a garbled mess on your screen.


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 14



            The Chat window is divided horizontally.  The top half of the
          screen is where received characters are written, the bottom half
          is where the characters you type are written.

            To exit Chat Mode, press the <Esc> key.

          Please note: Some BBS "chat" systems send special control
          characters to emulate a split screen chat or colors.  Since there
          is no filtering done by MyComm while in Chat Mode this may cause
          strange looking characters in your receive window.  If this
          occurs, exit from Chat Mode and allow the BBS software to control
          the chat session.

          3.4  Send Break - Alt B

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "B" key sends a special modem signal
          called "BREAK".  Some host systems use the Break signal to
          perform special functions such as ending a session.


          3.5  Clear the Screen - Alt C

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "C" key clears the screen and resets
          the current color attributes.  Many host systems send color
          information which stays in place even after you log off. Clear
          Screen resets the screen colors to the ones you chose.


          3.6  Dialing Functions - Alt D

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "D" keys displays the MyComm Dial
          Screen.  From this screen you may add, delete, edit, view, find,
          and mark phone list entries, and of course dial phone list
          entries.  You will see the options available from this screen
          written into the little window at the bottom of the screen. The
          letter which activates an option will appear highlighted or in a
          different color.  A description of the dialing functions follows.


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 15



            You will see a bar highlighting the current phone list item.
          The highlight bar may be moved up and down by using the Up-Arrow,
          Down-Arrow, Page Up, Page Down, Home and End keys.  The highlight
          bar appears as reverse video bar on monochrome screens.

          3.6.1  Add Phone List Item

            Pressing the "A" key in the Dial Screen window adds a blank
          entry after the currently highlighted entry.

            Pressing the "E" key in the Dial Screen window brings up the
          Dial Edit window.  This is where you set up the phone list entry
          for each system you will call.  There are several options to
          choose from, and each is described.  You may also use the Up-
          Arrow and Down-Arrow keys to move between items.  Items such as
          Name, Number, etc use MyComm's Line Editor described in Appendix
          B.

          The following describes each phone list item and how to configure
          it.

          3.6.2.1  Name

            Just type in the name of the bulletin board system or person
          you will call here.


          3.6.2.2  Number

            The telephone number of the system you will call goes in here.
          The telephone number may include spaces or hyphens for
          readability (modems usually ignore spaces and hyphens).
          Characters such as letters or other gibberish will probably
          confuse your modem.  MyComm will assume that whatever you put
          here is a valid telephone number.


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 17



          3.6.2.3  Baud Rate

            Choose a baud rate (300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400,
          57600, or 115200) that you want MyComm to use when connected to
          the system.  For a more accurate reading of the data rate during
          file transfers (described elsewhere in this manual) and the on-
          line status (also described elsewhere in this manual) the baud
          rate should be set to the rate of the system that you will be
          calling.


          3.6.2.4  Data Bits

            Choose the data bits (5, 6, 7, 8) that you want MyComm to use
          when connected to the system.  8 data bits is the most common
          setting for public bulletin board systems.  7 data bits are
          common on mainframes and many Unix (Tm) systems.  5 and 6 data
          bits are rarely used by many systems any longer, but are included
          for completeness.

            Most host systems in their advertisements, etc. tell you what
          Data, Parity, and Stop bits they expect.  You will often see them
          listed as 8-N-1 or similar.  8-N-1 means 8 data bits, no parity
          (None), and 1 stop bit. 8-N-1 is the most common setting used.
          If in doubt, try 8-N-1 first.


          3.6.2.5  Data Parity

            Choose the data parity (None, Even, Odd, Mark, Space) that you
          want MyComm to use when connected to the system.  None is usually
          used on most systems, especially with 8 data bits.  Even parity
          is common when using 7 data bits.


          3.6.2.6  Stop Bits

            Choose the stop bits (1, 2) that you want MyComm to use when
          connected to the system.  1 stop bit is the most common.


          3.6.2.7  Default Protocol

            MyComm allows you to choose the file transfer protocol that you
          will use by default for each system you call.  Choose the
          protocol which best suits your needs.  A more complete
          description of the various protocols is found later in this
          manual in the section on Uploading and DownLoading Files.


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 18



          3.6.2.8  Dial Prefix

            Choose the dialing prefix that you want MyComm to use when
          calling the number for this system.  MyComm has slots for three
          different dialing prefixes.  Choose one by moving the highlight
          bar to the selection you want.  The dialing prefixes may be
          changed to suit your needs in the Update Configuration menu
          option.


          3.6.2.9  Logon Name

            This option lets you enter the name that you log on with when
          you call this system.  When bulletin board systems answer your
          call they usually ask for your name and password.

            Putting the characters "^M" at the end of the Logon Name causes
          an <Enter> character to be sent.  Some BBS's don't like seeing an
          <Enter> character immediately after the Logon Name string when
          logging on, in which case you should leave the "^M" out.

            If Logon Name is filled in MyComm will send your logon name
          when you push the <F2> key to save you some typing.


          3.6.2.10 Password
            This option lets you enter the password that you log on with
          when you call this system.  When bulletin board systems answer
          your call they usually ask for your name and password.

            If Password is filled in MyComm will send your logon password
          when you push the <F3> key to save you some typing.  If you are
          really security conscious, then you may leave this option blank.

            Putting the characters "^M" at the end of the Password causes
          an <Enter> character to be sent.  Some BBS's don't like seeing an
          <Enter> character immediately after the Password string when
          logging on, in which case you may leave the "^M" out.


          3.6.2.11 Terminal Type
            This option lets you choose the type of terminal emulation to
          use when calling this system.  The choices are TTY, ANSI, VT-52,
          VT-100 and 3270 (registered version only).

            TTY (TeleTYpe) gives no emulation what-so-ever. The characters
          appear on your screen just as they come in with no formatting.

            ANSI emulation provides functions similar to your ANSI.SYS
          driver to provide color attributes (except on mono monitors of
          course), blinking characters and other goodies.  MyComm uses


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 19



          intelligent ANSI character translation which filters out any ANSI
          sequences which cause "keyboard re-mapping".  This prevents the
          unscrupulous from sending ANSI sequences to your personal
          computer system that could potentially cause damage or annoyance.

            VT-52 and VT-100, and 3270 are most commonly used on mainframe
          hosts.  Some bulletin boards also support these.  Both of these
          emulations support a subset of the DEC protocols including a
          mapping to the "keypad mode" used to generate commands on DEC
          terminals.  It should be noted that VT-52 is an "ANSI
          incompatible" emulation, and VT-100 is ANSI compatible.

            A listing of the keys supported for the ANSI, VT-52, VT-100,
          and 3270 emulations is in Appendix C - Terminal Emulations.

          3.6.2.12 Local Echo

            Local Echo is used when the other system does not send the
          characters typed on your terminal back to you.  Most systems do
          echo characters back, so Local Echo is normally off ("No").  If
          you find that you can't see what you are typing when connected to
          a system, set Local Echo on ("Yes").  On the other hand if you
          see double characters when you hit a key (for example you see
          "xx" when you type an "x") then Local Echo should be off ("No").


          3.6.2.13 Received BS (BackSpace) Destructive

            This option tells MyComm whether received BackSpace or DELete
          characters should back up the cursor and erase what was there.
          Usually this On.


          3.6.2.14 BS Key Sends BS or DELete

            This option tells MyComm whether to send a BS (BackSpace - 8
          decimal) or DEL (Delete - 127 decimal) character when the
          backspace key is pressed.  Usually this is set to BS.  Mainframe
          hosts usually like to see DEL rather than BS.


          3.6.2.15 Strip Hi Bits

            This option tells MyComm whether to strip the high bit from
          received and sent characters. Usually this is set to "No".

            Just for your own information, bytes on the personal computer
          are 8 bits long.  So, the bit-map of a byte might be 10011101.
          The left-most bit is the high bit.  So if you were to strip the
          high bit, the byte above would become 00011101.  Pure ASCII only
          covers bytes in the range of 00000000 (0 decimal) to 01111111


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 20



          (127 decimal).  The ANSI extended set includes values from
          10000000 (128 decimal) to 11111111 (255 decimal).  So by
          stripping the high bit, a character is guaranteed to be in the
          range of the pure ASCII character set.


          3.6.2.16 Add LF after incoming CR

            This option tells MyComm whether to add a LF (Line Feed - 10
          decimal) character after a CR (Carriage Return - 13 decimal)
          character is received.  Usually this is set to "No".

            If you notice that the lines on the screen seem to look odd or
          do not scroll up properly, you will want to turn this on (Yes).


          3.6.2.17 Clear last date called and number of calls

            Each time you connect with a system MyComm updates the last
          date and time called portion the dialing entry record.  If you
          want to reset the date and time the system was last called and
          the number of times you have called it, answer "Yes" here.

          3.6.2.18 Script

            This is where you will put the name of the script file that you
          want to run ("Join") when you connect with this system.  For a
          complete discussion of the MyComm script language see Appendix -
          E "MyComm Script Language".


          3.6.2.19 Save Changes (not shown in example)

            MyComm asks if you want to save the changes you just made.  If
          you answer "Yes" MyComm updates the phone file on your disk
          drive.  When MyComm updates the phone file a backup of the phone
          file is created and named PHONE.OLD.


          3.6.3  Delete an Item

            Pressing the "T" key allows you to delete the item that is
          currently at the dialing highlight bar.  MyComm asks you to
          confirm the delete request before proceeding.  MyComm also
          updates the phone file on your disk drive.


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 21



          3.6.4  Call Numbers (Dial)

            Pressing the "C" key tells MyComm that it's time to start
          calling numbers in the Dialing List  (See also section 3.6.7
          (Un)MarK).  Pressing the <Enter> key also will start the dialing.

            If no Dialing List Items are "marked" MyComm will dial the
          number that the highlight bar is currently resting on.  If there
          are "marked" Dialing List Items, MyComm will start dialing the
          marked numbers in sequence until a connection is made.  During
          the dialing attempts you may cancel the dialing by pressing the
          <Esc> key.

            While MyComm is calling numbers and waiting for a connection, a
          Dial Status Window is displayed (see example below).  The status
          window shows who is being called and the telephone number, how
          many call tries have been made so far, the status of the last
          dialing try, the time in seconds until this try "times out", the
          time since you started calling, and the time that the current
          dialing attempt started.

          +---------------------------------------------------------------+

            Pressing the "N" key causes MyComm to stop dialing  the number
          it is currently dialing and to skip to the next marked number.

            Pressing the "D" key causes MyComm to stop dialing the number
          it is currently calling and to remove it from the list of
          "marked" numbers.  If you press "D" and the number is the only
          one left in the "marked" list, MyComm will give you a warning and
          stop dialing.

            The Dial Time and Pause Time between calls is a user
          configuration option which may be set up in the Update
          Configuration menu described later in this document.

          3.6.5  Phone Item Info Screen

            The Phone Item Info Screen looks very much like the Edit Phone
          List Item Screen with the exception that the Last Call Date, Last
          Call Time, and Number of Calls fields are shown.  If you see
          something you want to change, pressing "E" will bring you to the
          Edit Phone List Item Screen.

          3.6.6  Manual Dial Screen

            Pressing "M" brings up the Manual Dial Screen.  The Manual Dial
          Screen lets you enter a single phone number to dial.  The dialing
          prefix used is always Dialing Prefix number 1.
          Pressing <Esc> cancels the function.  Pressing <Enter> accepts
          the telephone number and the usual Dialing Status Window appears.

          3.6.7  Mark Phone List Items

            Pressing "K" marks or un-marks phone list items for later
          dialing.  As a convenience, pressing the <Space> bar also marks
          and un-marks items.  When a phone list item is marked a chevron
          ("¯") will appear next to the item.


          3.6.8  Find Phone List Items

            Pressing "F" brings up the Find Phone List Items screen (not
          shown).  Simply type in the characters in the name, or a partial
          phone number that you want to find.  The search is started at the
          top of the list.  If the search fails, a message is displayed.


          3.6.9  Load Phone List Screen

            Pressing "L" brings up the Load Phone List Screen.  You may
          keep more than one phone dialing list.  Each list will hold up to
          100 telephone numbers.  If the dialing list you select does not
          yet exist, MyComm will display an empty dialing list.
            Again, when changes are made to the phone file, MyComm will
          create or update the file PHONE.OLD as a backup.  There is only
          one PHONE.OLD backup file kept, so all new backups overwrite the
          last PHONE.OLD backup file.


          3.6.10 Sort Phone List

            You may sort the Phone List in one of four ways:

            - by BBS name
            - by Telephone number
            - by last date called
            - by number of times called

            The sort option will also ask you for Ascending or Descending
          sort order.  Simply select the sort option that best suits your
          needs.  The list will be saved in the new sort order.  Pressing
          <Esc> exits the Sort menu.

          3.6.11 Move Phone List Item

            This option allows you to move a phone list item to another
          location in the list.  This will save you some retyping if you
          want to customize your phone list.

            To use this option move the highlight bar to the phone list
          item that you want to move.  Press the "V" key.  Next use the up
          and down arrow keys to move the highlight bar to the position
          that you would like the item moved to.  Press the <Enter> key to
          make the move permanent, or <Esc> to quit the move.


          3.6.12 Print Phone List

            This option allows you to print the phone list.  The phone list
          may also be "printed" to a text file.  The printed output shows
          the BBS name, phone number, and last date called.

            To use this option press "P".  You will then be asked for a
          file name to "print" to.  To print to your printer (PRN) simply
          press <Enter> (PRN is a standard DOS device name for the
          printer).  A status message is displayed while the phone list is
          being printed.  The printing may be stopped by pressing the <Esc>
          key.


          3.7  Local Echo On/Off - Alt E

            Local Echo is used when the other system does not send the
          characters you typed on your terminal back to you.  Most systems
          do echo characters back, so Local Echo is normally off ("No").
          If you find that you can't see what you are typing when connected
          to a system, set Local Echo on (Yes).  On the other hand if you
          see double characters when you hit a key (for example you see
          "xx" when you type an "x") then Local Echo should be off ("No").


          3.8  Hang Up Modem - Alt H

              Pressing the <ALT> and the "H" key tells MyComm that you want
          to disconnect from your current telephone connection.  MyComm
          will try to hang up the phone first by dropping the modem signal
          called DTR, and if that fails by sending the Hang Up String
          defined in the Modem Setup Screen (see section 3.17.1  Modem
          Setup Screen).  If you don't want MyComm to use DTR to hang up
          the modem set the option "Use DTR to Hang Up Modem" in Modem
          Setup Screen to "No".

          3.9  Send Modem Initialization Strings - Alt I

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "I" key brings up the Send Init.
          String Menu shown below.  Choosing one of these options will send
          the Modem Initialization String, or the Hang Up String (same as
          <Alt> + H), or the Modem Attention String, or the Phone Answer
          String.  These strings are defined in the Modem Setup Screen (see
          section 3.17.1  Modem Setup Screen).

               +-------| Send... |+
               | Init. String     |
               | Hang Up String   |
               | Attention String |
               | Phone Answer     |
               +------------------+


          3.10 Join Script - Alt J

            This option will allow you to "Join" in or run a script file.
          You will be asked to supply the name of the script file which
          MyComm will then load.  If the script file can not be opened you
          will see an error message.  You may quit the script by pressing
          the <Esc> key until you see the "Yes/No" window that asks if you
          want to quit the script.  See Appendix-E "Script Language" for
          more information on script files.

          3.11 Present Line Status - Alt L

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "L" key brings up the Present Line
          Status Window.  This window tells you the current COM Port
          Status, i.e. what Port, Baud Rate, Data Bits, Parity Bits, and
          Stop Bits are in effect, whether you are on-line and for how
          long.  If you are on-line MyComm tells you the name of the system
          you are logged onto, and the default file transfer protocol.
          Also shown is the present Local Echo status and whether Session
          Capture is active.  Pressing <Esc> closes the window.

          +--------------------------| Present Line Status |+

          3.12 Scroll Back - Alt K

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "K" key brings up the "scroll back"
          buffer.  MyComm saves the last few screens of received text for
          you.  This option allows you to see what has been recently
          received in case there was something that went by too quickly
          that you would like to look at again.  The scroll back buffer
          saves about two to three screens worth of information depending
          on how much actual text was in the previous screens (about 4K's
          worth).  The scroll back buffer does not display ANSI or high bit
          characters, they are stripped out to leave more room for useful
          information.

            When the scroll back buffer is first shown it displays the very
          beginning of the buffer information.  The up-arrow, down-arrow,
          Page Up, and Page Down keys scroll the text.  You may also write
          the buffer to a file by pressing the "W" key.  To exit press the
          <Esc> key.

          3.13 Manual Dial - Alt M

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "M" key brings up the Manual Dial
          Screen.  The Manual Dial Screen lets you enter in a single phone
          number to dial.  The dialing prefix used is always Dialing Prefix
          number 1.  The parity setting is always 8-N-1.
          If you press <Esc> you may cancel the selection.  Pressing
          <Enter> accepts the telephone number and the usual Dialing Status
          Window appears.  This is exactly the same function as in the
          Dialing Screen, selection "M", described above.


          3.14 Outside to DOS - Alt O

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "O" key lets you shell out of MyComm
          to DOS.  You may use the Outside to DOS even when you are on-
          line.  Typing "EXIT" on the DOS command line brings you back to
          MyComm.

            One point of interest here: if you switch to a different drive
          or directory while in the DOS shell, MyComm will automagically
          bring you back to the drive and directory you started from when
          you type "EXIT" to return to MyComm.

          3.14 Change Port Parameters - Alt P

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "P" key brings up the Change Port
          Parameters Screen (see example below).  MyComm will let you
          change the port configuration, even while on-line.  Please note
          however that changing the COM Port while on-line will probably
          disconnect the current session.  However Data, Parity, and Stop
          Bits may be changed.

            Please note that the changes done here are not permanent.  To
          make permanent changes to the COM port settings, you must use the
          "Update Configuration" which is brought up by pressing <Alt> and
          "U" then the "M" key.

          3.16 Quick Re-Dial - Alt Q

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "Q" key allows you to redial the
          last number that MyComm dialed.  This is especially useful for

          3.17 Run External Program - Alt R

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "R" key brings up the Run External
          Program Screen (not shown).  MyComm lets you define an editor
          program plus up to three other programs that you may run without
          leaving your MyComm session.  The external programs are defined
          in Paths Setup (see 3.19.2  Paths Setup).
            If there is not enough available memory to run the external
          program, the external program will not run and control passes
          directly back to MyComm.

          3.18 Session Capture On/Off/Pause - Alt S

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "S" key opens the MyComm Session
          Capture Screen (not shown).  You may either accept the default
          name that MyComm provides for the capture file or enter a new
          name.  If the Drive:\Path\Filename is in any way invalid, MyComm
          will issue an error message.  You may also press <Esc> to leave
          the Session Capture Screen without starting the Session Capture.

            After a Session Capture has begun pressing the <ALT> and the
          "S" key again will allow you to Close, or Pause/Resume the
          capture file.

            If you exit MyComm and forget to Close the Session Capture
          file, MyComm will do it for you.

            Please note that often while Session Capture is active, that
          the display may appear jerky, or start and stop from time to
          time.  This is normal during Session Capture as it is the time
          that MyComm is writing the file to disk.


            It may also be important to know that the Session Capture does
          not do any ANSI filtering.  What you see is what you get.
          Generally you will read the Session Capture file using a text
          editor or word processor when you are no longer "on line".  Text
          editors and word processors often perform ANSI filtering for you.


          3.19 Terminal Emulation - Alt T

            MyComm allows you to reset the Terminal Emulation even while
          on-line.  The options are: TTY, ANSI, VT-52, VT-100, and 3270.
          Further information on the emulation may be found in Appendix C -
          "Terminal Emulations".

          3.20 Update Configuration - Alt U

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "U" key brings up the Update
          Configuration Menu (see below).  From this menu you may choose
          various options to allow you to customize the MyComm
          configuration.  You may either use the Up and Down-Arrow keys,
          then press <Enter> to choose an option, or simply press the
          highlighted letter of the option you want.  A description of the
          options that may be configured follows.

          3.20.1  Modem Setup Screen

            The Modem Setup Screen (see below) allows you to make changes
          to the various setting that control the modem.  You may move from
          item to item by using the Up and Down-Arrow keys and then
          pressing <Enter>.  Some of the items use MyComm's built in line
          editor to modify the item, others use little pop-up Yes/No
          windows.  If you want to exit without making any changes, just
          press the <Esc> key.  A description of each item in the Modem
          Setup Screen follows.

          +---------------------------------------------------------------+


          3.20.1.1  COM Port

            The COM Port selection allows you to set various COM port
          settings.
            When you first installed your modem you probably set the COM
          port up for COM1, COM2, etc. use the setting correct for your
          modem.  If you set the wrong COM port in this area, MyComm
          doesn't mind, but won't let you dial numbers later on.

            MyComm does not re-initialize the COM port when you make
          changes in this menu.  The new COM port settings will be used the
          next time that you run MyComm.  If you need to change the COM
          port settings now, use the Alt-P function from the main terminal
          screen.

            The baud rate should be set to whatever the top speed of your
          modem is.  Refer to your modem user manual if you're not sure.

            The most common settings for the Data, Parity, and Stop bits
          are 8-N-1 (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit).  If you require
          different settings, this is the place to change them.

          3.20.1.2  Modem Initialization String

            This option lets you set up the Modem Initialization String.
          This is the string which is sent to the modem to "wake it up" and
          set options when MyComm is first loaded.  The initialization
          string is made up of Hayes "AT" commands.  The command line
          always starts with the letters "AT".  The rest of the line
          contains various options for your modem.  Your modem manual
          should have a list of the commands that are valid for your modem.

            MyComm always likes to have AT LEAST the Q0, V1, and X4
          commands.  Q0 tells the modem to ALWAYS send result codes, V1
          tells the modem to ALWAYS send the text, not numeric, result
          codes.  MyComm needs the result codes in text format to monitor
          call progress, and to send you other useful information that the
          modem produces.  X4 (your modem may use X1, X2, etc) tells the
          modem to send "verbose" modem status information to MyComm.
            You should place "^M" at the end of the Initialization String
          so that MyComm will send a Carriage Return at the end of the
          line.

          High speed modem users: If you need to set "flow control" options
          for your modem in the setup string this is the place to do it.
          For example, if your modem needs to use RTS/CTS flow control the
          Hayes AT command "&K3" should be added to the initialization
          string.


          3.20.1.3  Modem Attention String

            This is the Attention signal that tells the modem that you want
          it's undivided attention for something.  Most Hayes compatible
          modems use three plus signs "+++" as the attention string.  Refer
          to your modem manual if you use a different Attention string.


          3.20.1.4  Modem Hang Up String

            This is the string that tells your modem to hang up the
          telephone line.  On most Hayes compatible modems this is ATH0.
          You may use the characters "^M" to have MyComm send a Carriage
          Return after it sends the Hang Up string (recommended).  Refer to
          your modem manual if you use a different Hang Up string.


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 33



          3.20.1.5  Modem Answer String

            This is the string that tells your modem to answer the
          telephone.  On most Hayes compatible modems this is ATA.  You may
          use the characters "^M" to have MyComm send a Carriage Return
          after it sends the Answer string (recommended).  Refer to your
          modem manual if you use a different Answer string.


          3.20.1.6  Modem Cancel Dial String

            This is the string that tells your modem to cancel dialing a
          telephone number.  On most Hayes compatible modems this just a
          Carriage Return (13 decimal).  You may use the characters "^M" to
          send a Carriage Return after it sends the Cancel Dial string
          (recommended).  Refer to your modem manual if you use a different
          Cancel dialing string.


          3.20.1.7  Modem Dial Suffix String

            This is the string that tells your modem what to terminate
          telephone numbers with when dialing.  On most Hayes compatible
          modems this just a Carriage Return.  You may use the characters
          "^M" to have MyComm send a Carriage Return as the Dial Suffix
          string (recommended).  Refer to your modem manual if you use a
          different Dial Suffix string.


          3.20.1.8  Dialing Wait Time

            After MyComm dials a number it waits for this amount of time
          for a connection.  Waiting stops automatically if MyComm detects
          a BUSY signal.  The valid range for Dialing Wait Time is 1 to 240
          seconds.

            In general a wait time of 45 seconds is good for most local and
          long-distance calls, 60 seconds for international calls.

            You will also want to add "S7=nn" (without the quotes), to your
          modem Initialization String (see above). Replace "nn" with a
          number greater than or equal to the time set in Dialing Wait
          Time.


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 34



          3.20.1.9  Pause Between Calls

            If a connection is not made after dialing due to a BUSY signal
          or a time-out, MyComm resets the modem and waits the amount of
          seconds specified in the Pause Between Calls before trying to
          dial again.  The valid range for Pause Between Calls is 0 to 60
          seconds.

            In most cases a pause time of 2 to 5 seconds is sufficient for
          the modem to reset.


          3.20.1.10 Local Echo on by Default

            Local Echo is used when the other system does not send what you
          typed on your terminal back to you.  Most systems do echo
          characters back, so Local Echo is normally off ("No").  If you
          find that you can't see what you are typing when connected to a
          system, set Local Echo on (Yes).  On the other hand if you see
          double characters when you hit a key (for example you see "xx"
          when you type an "x") then Local Echo should be off ("No").


          3.20.1.11 Use DTR to Hang Up Modem

            This option allows you to set whether MyComm should use the
          modem signal called DTR to terminate connections.  Using DTR to
          hang up is usually faster than just sending the Hang Up String
          (above).  This option is usually set to "Yes".

            However, some modems don't like to have DTR messed with. You
          can usually tell if the modem doesn't like you to fool with DTR
          as it will cause your computer system to lock up (not a bad thing
          really, just terribly annoying - re-booting always fixes this).
          Refer to your modem manual if you have questions about whether to
          use DTR to hang up the telephone connection.

            NOTE: some modems require that you add "&D2" to your
          initialization string (see above) to enable the DTR line
          monitoring.  Check your modem manual for further details.

          3.20.1.12 Use XON/XOFF Flow Control

            This tells MyComm whether it should use the XON/XOFF flow
          control while in terminal mode and during ASCII file transfers.
          This default for this option is "Yes".


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 35



          3.20.1.13 Use CTS/RTS Flow Control

            This tells MyComm whether to use CTS/RTS flow control.
          This is used with high speed modems and null modem cable links to
          regulate the flow of data. If the modem supports CTS/RTS flow
          control this should be on (refer to the user manual for your
          modem).  If a null modem cable is being used and these signals
          are to be sent over the cable, this should be on.
            You may also want to add "&K3" to your initialization string
          (see above) to enable your modem to follow CTS/RTS status.  This
          option is most often used on high speed modems.


          3.20.1.14 Use DSR/DTR Flow Control

            This tells MyComm whether to use DSR/DTR flow control.

           Hardware handshaking is used with high speed modems and
          sometimes null modem cable links to regulate the flow of data.
          If the modem supports DSR/DTR flow control this should be "Yes"
          (refer to the user manual for your modem).  If a null modem cable
          is being used and these signals are to be sent over the cable,
          this should be on.

            You may also want to add "&D2" to your initialization string
          (see above) to enable your modem to follow DTR status.  This
          option is most often used on high speed modems.


          3.20.1.15 Dialing Prefixes

            Dialing Prefixes are dialing codes such as area codes, that get
          sent before a telephone number is dialed.  You may set up three
          different dialing prefixes.  Each dialing prefix may be up to 25
          character/digits long.

            For example, if you have Call Waiting (Tm) you can disable it
          by dialing *70 (that's asterisk - 70) before the number you're
          calling (this works in the my dialing area, your dialing area may
          differ).  If you were to set one of your dialing prefixes to *70
          MyComm would "prefix" every number you called with *70.  The
          dialing prefixes may also be used to store long distance codes,
          or whatever dialing codes you would want to have dialed before a
          number.


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 36



          3.20.1.16 Connect Strings

            MyComm will use the strings defined in Connect and No Connect
          strings to determine the dialing status.  From this option you
          will be able to change the strings that MyComm will use as
          responses from your modem.

            There is one "Connect" string and four "No Connect" strings.

            The Connect string should be the same as the one your modem
          generates when a connection has been made.  The default is
          "CONNECT" which is fairly standard.  Please note: you must define
          this string so that MyComm will know when a connection has been
          made.  MyComm does not rely on the Carrier Detect signal to
          determine when it has connected during dialing!

            The "No Connect" strings should be set to whatever strings your
          modem generates when a connection is not made during dialing.
          When MyComm sees one of these responses from the modem during
          dialing it stops waiting for a connection and moves on to the
          next number to be dialed.  The default strings are "BUSY", "NO
          CARRIER", "NO DIALTONE", and "VOICE".


          3.20.2  Paths Setup

            The Paths Setup Screen (see below) is where you set up paths to
          directories that you want MyComm to know about.  A description of
          the various system paths follows.

          3.20.2.1  Download Directory

            This option tells MyComm which directory you want MyComm to put
          files that are downloaded from another system.  Notice that the
          path always ends in a backslash ( "\" ) character.


          3.20.2.2  Upload Directory

            This option tells MyComm which directory you want MyComm to get
          the files from that will be uploaded to other systems.  Notice
          that the path always ends in a backslash ( "\" ) character.


          3.20.2.3  Path\File for Screen Capture

            This option tells MyComm which directory and the filename that
          you want MyComm to use for the Screen Capture file.  Screen
          Capture is activated by <Alt> + W.


          3.20.2.4  Session Capture Path\File

            This option tells MyComm which directory and the filename that
          you want MyComm to use for the Session Capture file.  Session
          Capture is activated by <Alt> + S.


          3.20.2.5  Phone File Path\File

            This option tells MyComm which directory and the filename that
          you want MyComm to use for the Phone File which contains your
          dialing directory.  You may have multiple Phone Files, but this
          is the one that MyComm will load when it starts up.


          3.20.2.6  Editor Path\Filename

            If you want to use an editor program without leaving MyComm,
          this option lets you tell MyComm the path and filename of the
          editor.  Notice that the filename of the editor must include not
          only the filename, but the extension (.EXE or .COM) as well.


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 38



          3.20.2.7  External Programs Path\Filename

            You may define up to three other external programs to run
          without leaving your MyComm session.  Use these options to tell
          MyComm the paths and filenames of the programs.  Notice that the
          filename of the programs must include not only the filename, but
          the extension (.EXE, .COM, or .BAT) as well.


          3.20.3  Protocols Setup

            The Protocols Setup Menu (see example below) allows changes to
          parameters for ASCII file transfers, Zmodem file transfers, and
          the external protocols.
          The usage of these options follows.

          3.20.3.1  ASCII Transfers Setup

            The ASCII Transfers Setup screen (see example below) lets you
          set up the parameters for ASCII file transfers.  ASCII file
          transfers are only used to transfer text files.  Program files
          and archived files, also known as binary files, should not be
          transferred as ASCII files.  Most of the options for the ASCII
          transfers work well with their default settings.  A description
          of the different options follows.

          +-----------------------------------------------------+


          3.20.3.1.1  Strip High Bits
            This option tells MyComm whether to strip the high bit from
          received and sent characters during ASCII uploads and downloads.
          Usually this is set to "No".  See also section 3.6.2.15 "Strip
          High Bits" for a discussion of "high bits".


          3.20.3.1.2  Remote Abort Char

            If the system you're performing the ASCII file transfer with
          uses an abort char to cancel transfers you should set this value.
          The value is in the range of 1 to 255.  A value of zero (0), the
          default, means MyComm won't look for the abort character during
          ASCII file transfers.


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 40



          3.20.3.1.3  CR Translation Upload and Download

            Some systems require a CR (Carriage Return) character placed
          before the LF (Line Feed) character during ASCII file transfers.
          If the lines of the file look odd after the transfer, this may be
          the case.


          3.20.3.1.4  LF Translation Upload and Download

            Some systems require a LF (Line Feed) character placed after
          the CR (Carriage Return)  character during ASCII file transfers.
          If the lines of the file look odd after the transfer, this may be
          the case.


          3.20.3.1.5  Local Echo On During Uploads

            During ASCII uploads if you want to watch the file transfer set
          this option to "Yes".  This is often used when uploading a
          message into a bulletin boards message base.  When this option is
          set to "No", the usual file transfer window is shown as the
          upload progresses.


          3.20.3.1.6  Expand Blank Lines to Spaces

            This option tells MyComm to expand lines that are empty except
          for a CR/LF into a line of spaces that end with a CR/LF.  This is
          useful when you are uploading a message to a bulletin board.
          Some boards interpret a blank line with only a CR/LF as the end
          of message signal.  Expanding blank lines allows you to upload
          the entire message.


          3.20.3.1.7  Line Pace Time

            This options tells MyComm to how much time to wait between
          sending each line of text from the ASCII file.  Some systems
          can't handle high speed ASCII transfers, this gives the other
          system time to "think".  The value entered from 0 (the default)
          to 255 are in increments of 1/10 second (approximately).


          3.20.3.1.8  Character Pace Time

            This options tells MyComm how much time to wait before sending
          each character from the ASCII file.  Some systems can't handle
          high speed ASCII transfers, this gives the other system time to
          "think".  The value entered from 0 (the default) to 255 is in
          increments of 1/10 second (approximately).


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 41





          3.20.3.1.9  Pacing Char

            Some systems send a Pacing Character to limit throughput on
          ASCII transfers.  MyComm will wait for the Pacing Char before
          sending each line of the file.  The Pacing Char value ranges from
          1 to 255 which represents an ASCII value.  A value of zero (0),
          the default, means MyComm will not look for the Pacing Char.


          3.20.3.2  Zmodem Transfers Setup

            MyComm lets you define certain special functions used in the
          Zmodem file transfer protocol.  A description of these follows.


          3.20.3.2.1  Zmodem 32 Bit CRC

            Zmodem uses either a 16 bit or a 32 bit CRC for error detection
          during file transfers.  The 32 bit CRC provides a much higher
          degree of accuracy than its 16 bit cousin.  However the
          calculation involved in the 32 bit CRC may slow the file transfer
          rate (by only a few CPS though).  If you want a high degree of
          error detection this option should be set to "Yes".  For higher
          transfer speed, set this option to "No".


          3.20.3.2.2  Zmodem Auto Download Feature

            When this option is set to "Yes" MyComm will automatically
          start a Zmodem download file transfer for you.  The Zmodem
          protocol at the host's end sends some special characters when it
          starts up a Zmodem transfer.  MyComm looks for these characters
          and will save you some typing by starting up the Zmodem download
          for you.  If you don't want to use this feature, set this option
          to "No".


          3.20.3.2.3  Zmodem Send Crash Recovery

            Sometimes a file transfer will fail after a file has been
          partially sent.   A file transfer could fail due to excessive
          line noise for example.  Zmodem has a rather nifty feature that
          will attempt to restart a failed file transfer.

            For normal use this feature should be set to "No".  If you want
          to attempt to restart a failed Zmodem transfer set this option to
          "Yes" before beginning the upload again.  If the system you are
          trying to upload the file to supports the "Crash Recovery"
          feature the file transfer will resume where it left off.


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 42





          3.20.3.2.4  Zmodem Receive Crash Recovery

            Sometimes a file transfer will fail after a file has been
          partially received.  Zmodem has a rather nifty feature that will
          attempt to restart a failed file transfer.

            For Normal use this feature should be set to "No".  If you want
          to attempt to restart a failed Zmodem transfer then set this
          option to "Yes" before beginning the download again.  If the
          system you are trying to download the file from supports the
          "Crash Recovery" feature the file transfer will resume where it
          left off.

            THIS OPTION SHOULD BE USED WITH CARE.  If this option is set to
          "Yes" and you download a file from another system that has the
          same name as a file you already have in your download directory,
          the end of the existing file will be overwritten with the
          information from the new file.  This option should only be set to
          "Yes" when you are attempting to restart a previously failed
          Zmodem transfer.

            NOTE: the Zmodem Crash Recovery option has some rudimentary
          idiot proofing.  The option will not perform the transfer if the
          file you have has a different time/date stamp than the other
          system, or if the file that you have is larger than the file on
          the other system.

          3.20.3.3  External Protocols Setup

            Up to six external file transfer protocols may be defined.
          Once defined the external file transfer protocols will appear in
          the Upload and Download protocol selection menus.
            Use the Up and Down-Arrow keys to move from item to item.  The
          <Enter> key selects an item for editing and saves the completed
          edit.  Pressing the <Esc> key quits the edit.

          +---------------------------------------------------------------+

            The name of the external protocol should be typed in under the
          "Name" heading as you would like it to appear in the MyComm
          Upload and Download protocol selection menus.

            In the fields for Upload.Bat and Download.Bat you will enter
          the names of the DOS batch files that will be used to run the
          external protocol.  External file transfer protocols are run as
          DOS batch files from MyComm (see your DOS manual for information
          on batch files).

            In the selection marked "Ask FileName" tells MyComm whether you
          should be asked the name of the file when performing downloads
          (some file transfer protocols automatically get the filename for
          you).

            MyComm sends the COM Port number you are using, the Baud Rate,
          and the Drive:\Path\ and filename as parameters for the batch
          file.  Using the example above, let's say you are using an
          external protocol called "BigFast", your COM Port is 2, the Baud
          Rate is 2400, and your upload directory is "C:\PUBLIC\" and you
          are uploading a file called MYSTUFF.ARC. The batch file for
          Uploads with BigFast would look something like this:

              REM BigFast Upload batch file
              BigFast Send Port: %1  Baud: %2 %3


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 44



          the %1 would be replaced by a "2", the %2 by "2400", and the %3
          would be replaced with the name of the upload directory and the
          filename: "C:\PUBLIC\MYSTUFF.ARC" when MyComm calls the .BAT file
          to run.

            External file transfer protocols often differ quite a bit, but
          they usually come with enough documentation of their own to get
          you going.

          NOTE: Experience has shown that some external protocol drivers
          may not release the COM port properly when they have completed
          their business.  This causes the terminal to appear "locked" (no
          characters come across the scree).  MyComm attempts to restore
          the COM port after the external protocol has been called.  If
          your terminal appears locked the COM port can be reset by using
          the <ALT> + P function from the terminal window.


          3.20.4  Miscellaneous Options Setup

          3.20.4.1  Screen Background Color

            This option tells MyComm what color to use for the screen
          background color.  This option only affects the screen of the
          terminal window.

          3.20.4.2  Screen Text Color

            This option tells MyComm what color to use for the screen
          foreground (the text) color.  This option only affects the screen
          of the terminal window.


          3.20.4.3  Date Format Style

            You may choose three date formats for MyComm to use when it
          displays dates:  MM/DD/YY,  DD/MM/YY, or YY/MM/DD.  Choose
          whichever one best fits your mood.


          3.20.4.4  12 or 24 Hour Time Format

            MyComm will display the time in either 12 hour or 24 hour
          format. Choose the one that bests reflects how you identify with
          time.


          3.20.4.5  Make Noise When Calls Connect

            MyComm sounds a short alarm noise when a connection is made
          during dialing.  If you don't want MyComm to sound the alarm, set
          this option to "No".


          3.20.4.6  Make Noise After File Transfers

            MyComm sounds a short alarm noise after a file transfer has
          completed.  If you don't want MyComm to make the noise, set this
          option to "No".


          3.20.4.7  Use Direct Video

            MyComm by default uses a system called "direct video" when
          displaying information to the screen.  Unfortunately, direct
          video will often "bleed through" to other programs in a
          multitasking environment.  If you are using a multitasker and
          getting bleed through from MyComm, set the Direct Video option to
          "No".

          3.20.4.8  Your Name for sign on

            This option lets you enter the name that you log on with when
          you call systems.  When bulletin board systems answer your call
          they usually ask for your name and password.  This name becomes
          the default for "Logon Name" for new numbers you add to the
          dialing directory.  If Logon Name is filled in MyComm will send
          your logon name to systems when you push the <F2> key to save you
          some typing.


          3.20.4.9  Password for sign on

            This option lets you enter the password that you log on with
          when you call systems.  When bulletin board systems answer your
          call they usually ask for your password.  This password becomes
          the default for "Logon Password" for new numbers you add to the
          dialing directory.  If Logon Password is filled in MyComm will
          send your logon password to systems when you push the <F3> key to
          save you some typing.


          3.20.4.10 Clever quip for TagLine

            Many BBS's have message areas where you can converse with other
          people.  If you want to be able to sign your name, leave a witty
          quote or whatever without typing it over and over for each
          message fill this area in.  When you press the <F4> key MyComm
          will send the message you have entered here.  The message can be
          up to 40 characters long.  You may also send ANSI "Escape"
          sequences (see DOS manual) from the Tagline.

            If you want to send the ASCII "ESCape character (27 decimal, 1B
          hex) which usually precedes ANSI escape sequences, MyComm uses
          the characters "^[ ". ("caret" sign left bracket).  For example,
          the ANSI.SYS driver recognizes the string

          <Esc>[5mThis is blinking<Esc>[0m

          as a string that blinks. (note: <Esc> represents the 27 decimal
          (1B hex) character here).  So, if your Tagline looked like

          ^[[5mThis is blinking^[[0m

          the other system would display "This is blinking" as a blinking
          message line.

          3.20.4.11 Guess Up/Download Filename

            By default MyComm tries to "guess" the filename that you want
          to upload or download.  MyComm will make a best guess as to what
          you most recently typed that looked like a filename.  Having this
          option set to "Yes" can save you time and typing when performing
          file transfers.


          3.20.5  COM Port Addresses

            This option enables changes to the COM port addresses.  By
          default MyComm uses standard addresses and Interrupt Request
          Lines (IRQ) to communicate with your modem.  Most users will
          never have a need to use this option.  It is most commonly used
          when there is a conflict with a mouse or other serial device and
          the modem.  By changing the base address and IRQ line this
          problem can often be alleviated.  Modifying the COM port address
          table and IRQ settings can be tricky.  If you are not entirely
          certain that you know what you are doing this option is best left
          alone.

            You will see a table with the COM port number, the base address
          it is using, and the IRQ line.  You move from field to field by
          pressing the <Enter> key.  The base address is displayed in and
          should be entered as a hexadecimal number.  The IRQ line will
          take numbers between 2 and 7.

            After you make changes you will have to reinstall the COM port.
          This is done by going back to the main terminal window and
          pressing <Alt> and 'P' and following the "Change Port" menu.


          3.20.6  Restore to Defaults

            This option will reset the MyComm configuration information to
          it's defaults.  A message will appear warning you of this, and a
          second "Yes/No" screen will ask if you want to proceed.  The
          changes take effect immediately, but are not saved until you use
          the "Save Setup" option.


          3.20.7  Save Setup

            This option saves the changes you made to the various
          configuration items to the file MYCOMM.CFG.  If you make changes,
          but do not save them, the changes will only remain active until
          you exit from MyComm.

          3.21 Send Screen to File - Alt W

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "W" key takes a "snap shot" of the
          currently displayed terminal screen and writes it out to the file
          MYCOMM.SCR.  The resulting file will contain the text currently
          on the screen.


          3.22 Exit MyComm - Alt X

            Pressing the <ALT> and the "X" key brings up a message box that
          takes a Yes/No response.  Press "Y" to exit MyComm, or "N" or
          <Esc> to cancel.


          3.23 Help Screen - F1

            When you are in the main terminal window pressing the F1 key
          will show you a list of MyComm commands that are available to
          you.

          3.24 Send Name - F2

            When bulletin board systems answer your call they usually ask
          for your name and password.  This option sends the name that you
          log on with when you call a system if your name is filled in for
          the dialing directory entry for the system.


          3.25 Send Password - F3

            This option sends the password that you log on with when you
          call a system. See also "Send Name" above.


          3.26 Send Tagline  - F4

            This is used to sign your name, or put a short quote, up to 40
          characters at the end of a message.  This is set up in the
          "Miscellaneous Options Setup" screen.

          3.27 Transferring Files

            MyComm has a wide variety of built in file transfer protocols
          such as  Zmodem, Xmodem, Xmodem-1K, Ymodem Batch, Ymodem-G Batch,
          SEAlink, and of course ASCII.  There are also slots to include up
          to six external file transfer protocols if you would like to add
          more.

             You may Upload (send) files or Download (receive) files.  Most
          host systems will have you start the file transfer at their end
          first, and then wait for you to set up on your end.  Host systems
          usually wait about a minute or so for you to set up, so don't
          panic.

            All file transfer protocols on MyComm use 8-N-1 (8 data bits,
          No parity, and 1 stop bit).  MyComm automatically sets these
          settings for you before the file transfer begins, then switches
          back to what ever settings were in place before the transfer
          began.
            Except for ASCII file transfers, MyComm turns off the XON/XOFF
          flow control switch if you have it set on.  This is done to
          prevent the XON/XOFF codes as being mistaken as part of the
          incoming file.  The original state of the XON/XOFF flow control
          is restored at the end of the file transfer.  If your modem has
          its own built in XON/XOFF flow control setting, you should turn
          it off during file transfers (refer to your modem manual -
          usually the &K option).

            File transfers differ slightly from one host system to another.
          Basically you need to know three things:

               þ    whether you want to Upload (send) or Download (receive)
                    a file

               þ    the name of the file you want to send or receive

               þ    which file transfer protocol you want to use

            Probably you can figure out for yourself whether you are
          uploading or downloading from a system, and what the file name is
          that you want to transfer.  However you and the host system MUST
          use the same file transfer protocol or the transfer will fail.
          The tricky part sometimes is deciding which file transfer
          protocol to use.  There are so many!

            Actually it's easy to decide which file transfer protocol you
          want to use.  When you request a file transfer from the host
          system, they usually show you a list of file transfer protocols
          that their system supports.  Just pick one that both MyComm and
          the host system support, and you're on your way!


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 50



            The two most frequently used protocols are Xmodem and Zmodem.
          A little experimentation on your part will help you decide which
          of the file transfer protocols best meets your needs.

            A description of each of the file transfer protocols that
          MyComm supports will be found later in this section.

          3.27.1  Starting a File Transfer

            The steps to start the file transfer from your end with MyComm
          are simple:

               þ    Press PgUp to send files, or PgDn to receive files

               þ    Choose the file transfer protocol you want to use from
                    the menu

               þ    Type in the filename (if needed)

               þ    The file transfer will start and display a status
                    window

               þ    When the file transfer completes MyComm makes a noise

            MyComm's file transfer menus and screens look basically the
          same for both uploads and downloads.  When you press PgUp or PgDn
          a menu pops up showing you the different file transfer protocol
          options you have (see example below).  Pick a protocol, or press
          the <Esc> or "Q" key to cancel.

          Download Protocol Menu Example

                                  +------| Down Load |+
                                  | ASCII             |

          (example)               | Quit/None         |
                                  +-------------------+

            After you pick a file transfer protocol, MyComm will ask you
          for the filename that you want to send or receive.  Some of the
          file transfer protocols for receiving files, such as Ymodem Batch
          and Zmodem, don't need to ask you the file name so you may not
          always be asked for a filename.  MyComm ALWAYS asks for the
          filename when you upload files.


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 51



          Note:
            When you upload files with the "batch" protocols you may also
          use the DOS "wildcard" characters for filenames such as *.* or
          ALL*.ARC, or FILE??.*, etc.

            If the filename, or the path to the file (the directory) are
          invalid or can't be found you will see an error message and you
          may re-enter the filename.  If you want to exit without
          performing the file transfer press the <Esc> key.

            When the filename is entered correctly MyComm will start the
          file transfer and the File Transfer Status Window shown below
          will pop up.

            The status window displays information about the file transfer
          such as the file name being sent/received, an estimate of how
          long it will take to do the transfer, the elapsed time, the CPS
          rate (Characters Per Second), the bytes sent/received, the blocks
          sent, error correction type, and error status.

          Note:
            Some protocols will not tell you the Xfer Time or the Bytes
          Expected during downloads.  This is because some protocols do not
          send an information "header" packet that tells MyComm how many
          bytes to expect from the sender.

            When MyComm calculates the amount of time a transfer will take
          it does the calculation based on a "worst case" rate of 80%
          efficiency. This is to take into consideration possible line
          noise, packet resends, and other considerations.  Actual file
          transfers may be faster than what MyComm calculates.


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 52



            The CPS rate reflects only the number of bytes actually
          sent/received from/to the file.  Overhead bytes such as CRC and
          "escape" characters are not included in the calculation.  This
          provides a more realistic picture of the file transfer progress.


          3.27.2  File Transfer Hints

               þ    Both the sender and receiver MUST use the same file
                    transfer protocol

               þ    If a file transfer keeps aborting using one protocol on
                    a host system, try using a different one.

               þ    It is not a good idea to upload or download from floppy
                    disk.  Floppy drives are slow, so the read and write
                    access time will slow down the transfer.  Floppy drives
                    do not hold very much data.  If the floppy disk were to
                    fill up during a download, the transfer would be

          3.27.5  ASCII File Transfers

            ASCII file transfers are only used to transfer text files.
          Program files, also known as binary files, should not be
          transferred as ASCII files.  ASCII uploads do not show the File
          Transfer Status Window unless you have set the "Show Upload"
          option to "No" in the ASCII Xfer configuration menu.  ASCII
          transfers have no error correction, but just plough along as
          though the characters were actually being typed from the
          keyboard.  This is commonly referred to as a "send and pray"
          protocol.

            During ASCII downloads, the download continues until either a
          Ctrl-Z (end of file marker) is received, or no characters have
          been received for 10 seconds.  You may also stop the transfer at
          any time by pressing the <ESC> key.

          3.27.6  SEAlink Derived File Transfers

            SEAlink is an advanced version of Xmodem developed by System
          Enhancement Associates.  SEAlink uses a "sliding window" protocol
          which sends ahead several packets while waiting for an
          acknowledgement from the receiver.  This can result in transfers
          that are 10 to 20 percent faster than plain Xmodem.  SEAlink
          sends the file name and file size when the transfer starts up,
          and can be used to send more than one file at a time.

            The version of SEAlink that MyComm uses is known as "Derived
          SEAlink" as MyComm does not support the "overdrive" option which
          is only used in half-duplex links.


          3.27.7  Xmodem File Transfers

            Xmodem is probably the most widely used protocol today.  Xmodem
          was originally developed by Ward Christensen in the summer of
          1977 for use on CP/M machines, and was soon ported to the MS-DOS
          environment.  Xmodem sends data in 128 byte blocks.  The block
          count seen in the File Transfer Status Window shows the number of
          128 byte blocks that have been transferred.  This has
          euphemistically been called "Xmodem blocks" and has become
          somewhat of a standard in P.C. data communications.

            Xmodem has two flavors; Check Sum and CRC-16 mode.  MyComm
          supports both Check Sum and CRC-16 mode, and automatically
          selects the correct one to use.  The check sum mode is not nearly
          as reliable as CRC-16, and isn't used as often.

          3.27.8  1K-Xmodem File Transfers

            Xmodem-1K is a variation of Xmodem which uses a 1K (1024 byte)
          block to send data.  Under most conditions Xmodem-1K is slightly
          faster than plain Xmodem.  If there is a lot of line noise
          however, the throughput can degrade due to having to perform a
          resend on the larger packet.

            Some older host systems may refer to Xmodem-1K as "Ymodem" so
          read the host system menu carefully.

          3.27.9  Ymodem Batch File Transfers

            The Ymodem Batch protocol can perform either single or batch
          file transfers.  That is, it can send or receive one or more
          files in a transfer session.  Ymodem Batch starts sessions by
          sending the file name and size to the receiver, then sends the
          file data.  Ymodem uses both a 128 byte or 1024 byte (1K) packet
          size and MyComm chooses the correct packet size to use during the
          transfer.


          3.27.9  Ymodem-G Batch File Transfers

            The Ymodem-G Batch protocol is similar to the regular Ymodem
          Batch protocol. The difference is that Ymodem-G performs no error
          correction what-so-ever and as such it is generally only used
          with error correcting modems, or Null modem cables.  If an error
          is detected during a transfer, the transfer is immediately
          aborted.


           3.27.11 Zmodem File Transfers

            Zmodem is another widely used file transfer protocol.  It was
          developed by Chuck Forsberg/Omen Technology, Inc.  Zmodem is an
          extremely robust protocol as it recovers from errors well and
          will try to keep the file transfer session going under adverse
          conditions.

            Zmodem will perform both single file and batch (multiple) file
          transfers.  Like Ymodem, when receiving a file using Zmodem, you
          don't have to type in the file name on your end.  Zmodem sends
          the filename as part of a special "header" that MyComm
          recognizes.

            Zmodem uses either a 16 bit or 32 bit CRC (Cyclic Redundancy
          Check) when transferring the file.  You will see the CRC type
          displayed in the File Transfer Status Window.  The CRC is used
          for error checking during the transfer.  MyComm automatically
          selects the proper CRC type to use so you don't have to worry
          about it.  The 16 bit CRC transfers often go a little faster than
          32 bit CRC transfers.  However the 32 bit CRC is much more
          reliable for error correction, and well worth the few seconds
          added to the transfer time.

          3.27.11 External Protocol File Transfers

              MyComm lets you define up to six external file transfer
          protocols.  The external file transfer protocols will also appear
          in the Upload and Download protocol selection menus.

            External protocols are set up in the External Protocols Setup
          (see section 3.20.3.3 "External Protocols Setup").  External
          protocols differ from vendor to vendor, so you should refer to
          the particular protocol's documentation for more detailed
          installation instructions.  MyComm invokes the external protocols
          through the use of DOS "batch" files.  Parameters are passed to
          the batch file in the following order: COM Port number (0 to 7),
          BPS rate, and Drive:\Path\Filename which translate to batch
          parameters %1, %2, and %3.


          3.27.12 MyComm as a Host

            At this point in time MyComm does not have a "host" mode per
          Se.  This was a design decision in order to keep the code size
          small.  A stand-alone host program is presently being considered
          for development at the moment.

            But, all hope is not lost.  It is entirely possible to transfer
          files between two MyComm programs (or MyComm and another
          communication program).  To do this one person acts as the
          "host", and the other as caller.  As the caller you would just
          call the other person as you would for any other bulletin board
          system.

          For this example, let's say you're the host since that's the
          complicated part.

          Step 1:   Prearrange a time for the other person to call you.

          Step 2:   Get MyComm up and running.

          Step 3:   When the other person calls you will hear the phone
                    ringing or see the word "RING" appear on the MyComm
                    terminal screen.  When you see "RING", type ATA then
                    press the <Enter> key.  This tells your modem to answer
                    the phone and initiate the carrier tones so the two
                    modems will "talk" to each other.  Alternatively you
                    could press <Alt> and the "I" key, then press "A" for
                    the "Send Answer String" command.


          MyComm Version 2.15 Documentation                    Page 56



          Step 3a:  Alternative to Step 3: before the other person calls
                    type ATS0=1 then press <Enter>.  This tells your modem
                    to answer the modem on the first ring and to initiate
                    the carrier tones.

          Step 4:   When transferring files from one MyComm to another
                    remember that when they are uploading, you are
                    downloading and vice versa.  So if the other person
                    wants to download a file from you they would start the
                    download function at their end, and you would start an
                    upload from your end.  The most important things to
                    decide before doing the transfer are:

                      - who is uploading/downloading to and from who

                      - which file transfer protocol you are using (they
                        MUST be the same)

                      - and finally, what the filename is.

          Step 4a   This is where the MyComm "chat" mode can be handy.  It
                    can help you establish stuff while you're on-line with
                    the other person.  If you would like to "chat" on-line
                    with the other person, Press <Alt> and the "A" key to
                    bring up the MyComm split screen chat mode (see section
                    3.3 "Chat Mode").

          Step 5:   If all goes smoothly the file transfer will be
                    successful.  In fact for the most part it will be as
                    though you had simply called another BBS, except this
                    time you're interacting with a live person rather than
                    the BBS software.

          Appendix B - MyComm Line Editing Functions

            Many of the user configuration options and the dialing list
          have sections that require a line of text to be input and edited.
          MyComm has a built in line editor to perform simple editing on
          these text lines.  The MyComm line editor uses a tiny subset of
          WordStar type commands.  A description of the line edit commands
          follows.

          þ Enter       -     Terminates editing the line and keeps it

          þ Esc         -     Terminates editing the line and does not keep
                              it

          þ Right Arrow -     Moves the cursor right.

          þ Left Arrow  -     Moves the cursor left.  This is "non-
                              destructive", the character is not erased as
                              the cursor moves

          þ BackSpace   -     Moves the cursor left.  This is
                              "destructive", the character is erased as the
                              cursor moves

          þ End         -     Positions the cursor at the end of the line

          þ Home        -     Positions the cursor at the beginning of the
                              line

          þ Ctrl + T    -     When the Ctrl key and the letter T are
                              pressed simultaneously, the line is erased
                              from the current cursor position to the end
                              of the line

          þ Ctrl + Y    -     When the Ctrl key and the letter Y are
                              pressed simultaneously, the entire line is
                              erased and the cursor is positioned at column
                              one






          Appendix C - Terminal Emulation

            This is a list of the functions that MyComm supports in the
          terminal emulators.

          TTY

            TTY does not provide any character translation what-so-ever.
          The characters are simply displayed as they come in.


          ANSI

            ANSI provides mapping similar to that found in your ANSI.SYS
          driver.  The color and screen attributes as described in the
          "MS-DOS 5.0 User's Guide and Reference" are supported, except for
          the keyboard mapping functions.  The following keys also generate
          codes recognized by other systems operating in ANSI mode:

            Direction (Arrow) Keys  - move cursor
            Delete                  - sends DEL (127 decimal)
            End                     - erase to end of line
            Home                    - homes cursor
            Ctrl-Home               - clears screen, and homes cursor
            Function Keys           - do not generate a character






          VT-52 and VT-100

            The VT-52 and VT-100 emulations are typically used with
          mainframe environments.  These emulations provide a subset of the
          "application keyboard" functions defined in the "VT-200
          Programmer Guide", Digital #EK-VT220-HR-001.  These emulations
          will work in either a 7 or 8 bit environment.  A standard key pad
          for these terminals looks like this:

              +-----------------------+
              | PF1 | PF2 | PF3 | PF4 |
              |-----+-----+-----+-----|
              |  7  |  8  |  9  |  -  |
              |-----+-----+-----+-----|
              |  4  |  5  |  6  |  ,  |
              |-----+-----+-----+-----|
              |  1  |  2  |  3  |  R  |
              |-----------+-----|  T  |
              |     0     |  .  |  N  |
              +-----------------------+

            MyComm defines these keys as follows:

            PF1 through PF4     - <SHIFT> + F1 through F4
            1 through 0         - <ALT> + F1 through F10
            Minus Sign "-"      - <SHIFT> + F5
            Comma ","           - <SHIFT> + F6
            Decimal Point "."   - <SHIFT> + F7
            RTN (Enter key)     - <SHIFT> + F8

          NOTE: the above keys are the function keys on a standard PC
          keyboard.  The PC numeric keypad has not been mapped to these
          keys.
          Also defined:

            Direction (Arrow) Keys  - move cursor
            Delete                  - sends DEL (127 decimal)
            End                     - erase to end of line
            Home                    - homes cursor
            Ctrl-Home               - clears screen, and homes cursor






          3270 Emulation - included in registered version only

            This emulation is most commonly used when connecting to IBM
          mainframe hosts.  This emulation should be used instead of VT-100
          emulation when connecting through the 7171 protocol converter.
          This emulation works best with 101 key PC keyboards (to get the
          PF11, PF12, PF23, and PF24 keys).  The mapping to the PC keyboard
          follows.

          Appendix D - Troubleshooting
          This section should answer common problems that you might have
          when using MyComm.

          Problem:

            - Modem doesn't respond.

          Possible Causes:

            -  Is the COM port the right one?  i.e COM 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
               or 8.

            -  Is the modem installed correctly?
            -  Is the modem really Hayes (Tm) compatible?

            -  If this is an external modem, are the cables hooked up?
               Is it plugged in?

            -  MyComm uses default address and interrupt vectors for    COM
               Ports of:

               COM Port   Address  IRQ Line
                  1        3F8        4
                  2        2F8        3
                  3        3E8        4
                  4        2F8        3
                  5        3E8        2
                  6        2F8        2
                  7        3E8        5
                  8        2F8        5

               If you have set these to something different, MyComm
          probably won't like it.  Reset the interrupt vectors to their
          standard settings.  If you don't know what this means, you
          probably didn't fool with it in the first place, so don't mess
          with it now.

            MyComm allows user configuration of addresses or interrupt
          vectors on the COM ports.  See the section "COM Port Addresses"
          for more information.






          Problem:

            - Modem won't hang up the phone line.

          Possible Causes:

            -  Some modems have a DIP switch setting that keeps Carrier
               Detect always on.  MyComm uses the Carrier Detect signal
               (CD) to see if it's on-line, and to see when the modem has
               released the phone line.  You should set your modem to let
               software, in this case MyComm, to handle the Carrier Detect
               signal.

            -  Try adding the Hayes command &C1 to your initialization
               string.  This tells the modem to raise Carrier Detect only
               when connected.

          Problem:

            - Modem dials, but doesn't know when the connection is made.

          Probable Causes:

            -  Make certain that the modem is sending text responses rather
               than numeric.  Add "Q0" and "V1" to your modem
               initialization string.

            -  Go into the "Modem Setup" screen and check the "Connect
               Strings" setting.  Make sure that they look like the ones
               your modem usually generates.

          Problem:

            -  The result codes from the modem are numbers instead of
               text.

          Possible Causes:

            -  Try adding Q0 and V1 to the modem initialization string.
               MyComm MUST see the result codes, and they have to be the
               English Text.  Also try adding X4 to the initialization
               string.

          Problem:

            -  When using a multitasker such as Windows (Tm), DoubleDOS
               (Tm), etc, the MyComm displays bleed through to other
               applications.

          Possible Causes:

            -  Set the option in the Miscellaneous Options Screen named
               "Direct Screen Writes" to "No".






          Problem:

            -  When I call some services, the characters look weird, or
               just garbage.

          Possible Causes:

            -  Make sure that the Baud Rate, Data Bits, etc. are set
               correctly. Most public BBS's use 8-N-1, but some may use 7-
               E-1 (often true with Unix (Tm) based systems and
               mainframes).

          Problem:

            -  File transfers seem to always time out or abort.

          Possible Causes:

            -  MyComm will abort a transfer if there are too many errors in
               the transfer due to line noise, or other unpredictable
               circumstances.

            -  Are you and the other guy are using the same file transfer
               protocol?






          Appendix E - MyComm Script Language

          1.0  Script Language Introduction

              This Appendix describes the format and syntax of the script
          language used by MyComm.  The MyComm script language is a series
          of commands in a text file that is read by MyComm to perform
          certain functions.  For example, a script function could send
          your name and password automatically when you log onto a system,
          then perform steps to navigate through the host system menus to
          gather your mail for you and then log off.

            The script language used in MyComm consists of 22 commands that
          are used to build scripts.  The script language is very simple,
          yet very powerful.  It is designed in such a way that ordinary
          people rather than programmers or technicians will find it easy
          to use and understand.  MyComm's script language should be no
          more difficult to use than writing DOS batch files.


          1.2  Creating a Script

            Scripts are created using a line editor, text editor, or word
          processing software that can save files as plain unformatted
          text.  It is similar to creating DOS "batch" files.

          To Create a Script

          Step 1:   Log onto the BBS or system that you want to create a
                    script for.  As you log on write down the sequence of
                    questions and responses that you receive and send.  For
                    example if the host system has a prompt that says
                    "Enter your Name:" and you type in your name at that
                    point, write down the question asked by the host system
                    and your response.  Optionally you may turn on the
                    Session Capture (ALT + "S") to save your responses for
                    later referral.


          Step 2:   Log off the BBS or system. No sense in tying up their
                    line.

          Step 3:   Use your text editor to write the script file.  The
                    script commands that MyComm understands are described
                    later in this Appendix.  The script file must be saved
                    to the same directory that the MyComm program is in
                    (for example C:\MYCOMM) so that MyComm can find it
                    later.

          Step 4:   Test your script with the MyComm Script Checker,
                    SCP_CHK.EXE (described later in this Appendix).  Revise
                    the script and re-test as necessary.






          Step 5:   Go to the Dialing Directory and edit the dialing entry
                    for this BBS.  There is an option called "Scripts".
                    Add the name of your script file here.

          Step 6:   Call the BBS and test your script.  Sometimes it may
                    take more than one try to get it all right.  Don't
                    worry, it happens to us all.

          2.0  Script Language

            The MyComm script language consists of 22 commands which will
          be described shortly.  The script files that you create must have
          the file name extension .SCP, and must be saved in the same
          directory that MyComm is in.  For example if you created a script
          for MyBbs, the script file would be named MYBBS.SCP.

            This manual will use the following conventions to describe the
          functions and the parameters that they take:

               FUNCNAME()     Function name is all CAPS. Please note that
                              no function name is over eight characters
                              long. All functions have the parameters
                              enclosed with parenthesis.  The parameters
                              are separated with commas.

               <int>          Integer parameter.

               <"string">     String parameter.  Please note that all
                              incoming and outgoing strings may be a
                              maximum of 60 characters in length.  Strings
                              are case sensitive, "PassWord" and "password"
                              are different strings!  Also note that the
                              strings are enclosed in quotes.  Since commas
                              are used as parameter delimiters, strings
                              must not contain embedded commas!

               <op1|op2|...>  Operator parameter.  Some functions use an
                              operator.

               <"label">      Label name.

               <Sn>           Parameter may be one of the string flags S0
                              through S9.

               <In>           Parameter may be one of the integer flags I0
                              through I9.

               (optional)     Indicates the next parameter is optional

               <"string"|Sn>  Parameter may either be a string constant or
                              one of the string flags.






               :label         Label within the script file.  All labels are
                              preceded by a colon ':' character.  Labels
                              may be up to eight (8) characters.

               comments       Comments are preceded by a semi-colon ';'.
                              The comments are free form and may be placed
                              anywhere.  The rest of the line after the
                              semi-colon is ignored by the script.

            The script functions are described in the following sections.
          The format of the descriptions is the function name, the
          parameter it takes, and a description. For example:

               WAITFOR(int waitsecs, "string"|Sn, (optional) "label"|Sn)

          indicates that the WAITFOR function takes an integer parameter, a
          string or "S" flag parameter, and an optional string or "S" flag
          parameter.
          2.1  Special Script Characters

            There are several special characters that MyComm will interpret
          for you when they are put into strings that you are sending to
          the host system:

          ^M ("caret" sign and capital "M")       This character sends a
                                                  "carriage return", as
                                                  though you had pressed
                                                  <Enter> on the keyboard.

          ^[ ("caret" sign and left bracket "[")  This character sends
                                                  <Esc> as though you had
                                                  pressed <Esc> on the
                                                  keyboard.

          ~ (tilde) -                             This character causes a
                                                  100 millisecond delay.
          2.2  Script Functions

            The next section describes the various script functions that
          are available.


          2.2.1  Labels

            Labels are used to produce logical execution branches within
          the script file.  Labels are used with the GOTO(<label>) function
          as well as several other functions which will branch when a
          condition is met.






          2.2.2  WAITFOR()

          format: WAITFOR(int waitsecs, "string"|Sn, (optional) "label"|Sn)

          WAITFOR() will wait up to <int> seconds for <string> and goto
          <label> if the <string> is received.  If the <string> is not
          received the next line in the script is executed.  Note that
          <label> is optional in which case the next line in the script
          would be executed regardless.

          For example if you wanted to wait 30 seconds for the string
          "PassWord" then jump to the label :GotPass

               WAITFOR(30, "PassWord", "GotPass")

          would do it.


          2.2.3  XMIT()

          format: XMIT("string"|Sn)

          Transmit a "string".  For example:

               XMIT("password")

          would send the string "password".


          2.2.4  GOTO()

          format: GOTO("label"|Sn)

          Jump to :label.  For example, if you have the label ":Lab001" in
          your script, GOTO("Lab001") would jump to that label.  Script
          execution resumes at the line after the label.


          2.2.5  SETFLAG()

          format: SETFLAG(In, int value)

          Set integer flag to a value.  The flags are referenced as flag 0
          through 9.  The flags can take on values between -999 and 9999.
          This function has the following format:

          For example to set flag 1 to 42:

               SETFLAG(I1, 42)






          2.2.6  INCFLAG()

          format: INCFLAG(In)

            The flags that were set (see SETFLAG() above) may be
          incremented by 1.  To increment flag 1:

               INCFLAG(I1)


          2.2.7  DECFLAG()

          format: DECFLAG(In)

            The flags that were set (see SETFLAG() above) may be
          decremented by 1.  To decrement flag 1:

               DECFLAG(I1)


          2.2.8  IFFLAG()

          format: IFFLAG(In, <EQ|GT|LT|GE|LE|NE>, int value, "label"|Sn)

            The integer flags may be tested for logical conditions.  If the
          condition is met script execution continues at the statement
          following the label.  The test condition operators are:

               EQ - equal
               GT - greater than
               LT - less than
               GE - greater than or equal
               LE - less than or equal
               NE - not equal

          If you wanted to test to see if flag 1 was EQual to 42, then jump
          to label :Lab001 you would enter:

               IFFLAG(I1, EQ, 42, "Lab001")

          NOTE: Quote characters are not used around the operators.






          2.2.9  IFSCAN()

          format: IFSCAN(Sn, "string"|Sn, "label"|Sn)

            You may set up to ten scan strings to continuously scan for.
          When the scan condition is met script execution continues at the
          statement following the label.  For example if you wanted to scan
          for the string "John Doe" and then jump to the label :Lab001 when
          it was found:

               IFSCAN(S1, "John Doe", "Lab001")

          IFSCAN() recognizes S0 through S9 as valid flag names.  The
          IFSCAN() function can be reset to scan for a new string by re-
          using the string variable. For example:

               IFSCAN(S1, "Bob Public", "Lab001")


          2.2.10 SENDNAME()

          format: SENDNAME()

            The SENDNAME() function will send the name that you have
          defined in your dialing directory entry for the BBS that the
          script is "Joined" to.  SENDNAME() take no parameters.  If the
          name entry in the dialing directory is blank nothing is sent.


          2.2.11 SENDPASS()

          format: SENDPASS()
            The SENDPASS() function will send the password that you have
          defined in the dialing directory entry for the BBS that the
          script is "Joined" to.  SENDPASS() take no parameters.  If the
          password entry in the dialing directory is blank nothing is sent.


          2.2.12 SENDFILE()

          format: SENDFILE(<op> A|S|X|K|Y|G|Z, "filename"|Sn)

            The SENDFILE() function is used to upload a file to the host
          system.  You will have to take care of any preparatory steps
          within the script, such as telling the host that you are sending
          a file.

          The parameters are a one letter designator for the protocol, and
          a "string" or string flag (S0..S9) for the filename.  The file
          that you are sending should reside in the "Upload Directory" that
          you have defined in MyComm.

            The valid operators for <op> are:






               A - ASCII
               S - SEAlink
               X - Xmodem
               K - Xmodem-1K
               Y - Ymodem Batch
               G - Ymodem-G
               Z - Zmodem

          For example if you wanted to send the file "MYCOMM.ARC" using
          Zmodem:

               SENDFILE(Z, "MyComm.ARC")


          2.2.13 RECVFILE()

          format: RECVFILE(<op> A|S|X|K|Y|G|Z, optional "filename"|Sn)

            RECVFILE() allows you to receive files from the host system.
          You will have to take care of any preparatory steps within the
          script, such as telling the host that you want to receive a file.

          See SENDFILE() (above) for the list of valid operators.

          For example if you wanted to download the file "STUFF.ARC" using
          Xmodem:

               RECVFILE(X, STUFF.ARC)

          Please note that SEAlink, Ymodem, Ymodem-G, and Zmodem do not
          require that a filename be specified.  These protocols send the
          filename in a special header.  The ASCII, Xmodem, and Xmodem-1K
          protocols always require that a filename is specified.

            NOTE: if you have the Zmodem "Auto Download" feature turned on
          there may be conflicts between the script Zmodem and the MyComm
          Zmodem.  If you have the Zmodem "Auto Download" feature turned on
          in MyComm the Zmodem file transfer will start automatically, and
          you will not need to use this function during Zmodem downloads.


          2.2.14 SNDBREAK()

          format: SNDBREAK(optional <int ms>)

            SNDBREAK() sends a "Break" signal for 1500 milliseconds.  It
          will also take an optional parameter for the number of
          milliseconds that the "Break" signal will be sent.






          2.2.15 ALARM()

          format: ALARM(optional <int ms>)

            ALARM() will make a noise for <int> milliseconds.  For example
          ALARM(1000) would sound a beep for one second.  The default alarm
          duration is 500 milliseconds (1/2 second).


          2.2.16 PAUSE()

          format: PAUSE(int seconds)

            PAUSE() will cause a delay for "seconds" seconds.  For example
          PAUSE(5) would pause the script for 5 seconds.


          2.2.17 HANGUP()

          format: HANGUP()

            The HANGUP() function causes the modem to disconnect.  HANGUP()
          uses the information from the MyComm configuration file to send
          the correct hang up string.


          2.2.18 IGNORECD()
          IGNORECD()

          format: IGNORECD("Yes"|"No"|Sn)

            This function "Ignore Carrier Detect" tells the script
          processor to ignore the state of the "Carrier Detect" modem
          signal.  By default if the carrier signal is lost the script
          exits.  In some cases, such as while waiting for an incoming
          call, it is useful for the script to continue execution even when
          there is no carrier signal.

            This function takes one parameter: a string of "Yes" or "No",
          or one the string variables (S0..S9).  A value of "Yes" turns off
          carrier detect monitoring within the script, "No" turns
          monitoring back on.






          2.2.19 SETSTR()
          SETSTR()

          format: SETSTR(Sn, "string"|Sn)

          SETSTR() sets one of the string variables S0 through S9 to a
          string constant or another string variable.  For example:

               SETSTR(S2, "This String")

          would set string variable S2 to "This String".

            Please note that the SETSTR() function resets the "goto" label
          of the string variable if that same string variable was
          previously assigned with the IFSCAN() function.

          2.2.20 GOSUB()
          GOSUB()

          format: GOSUB("label"|Sn)

            The GOSUB() function is used to branch execution in the script.
          It is similar to the GOTO() function except that later in the
          script a RETURN() function may be used which will transfer script
          execution to the statement following the last GOSUB().  For
          example:

               GOSUB("gosub1")     ; go to label "gosub1"
               <statement1>        ; execution resumes here after RETURN()
               <statement2>
                    ...
               <statement-n>

               :gosub1             ; label for GOSUB() to go to
               <statement1>
               <statement2>
                    ...
               <statement-n>
               RETURN()            ; return to statement after GOSUB()


          2.2.21 RETURN()
          RETURN()

          format: RETURN()

            The RETURN() function returns script execution to the statement
          following the most recent GOSUB().  See the description of the
          GOSUB() function above for details.






          2.2.22 EXIT()
          EXIT()

          format: EXIT()

            The EXIT() function exits the script and return control back to
          MyComm.

          2.2.23 QUIT()
          QUIT()

          format: QUIT()

            The QUIT() function exits from the script and MyComm
          completely.  Please note: QUIT() does not hang up the modem. If
          you would like the modem to disconnect the HANGUP() function
          should be used before QUIT().






          3.0  Script Syntax Checker

            The program SCP_CHK.EXE is used for checking the syntax of
          script files.  To use the program to check a script file type:

               SCP_CHK SCRIPT.SCP

          Replace SCRIPT.SCP with your file name.  Also the .SCP extension
          is assumed and you may leave it off if you like.  The output from
          SCP_CHK will be display on the screen, or you may redirect the
          output to a file.  For example

               SCP_CHK MYSCRIPT > MYSCRIPT.OUT

          would create the file MYSCRIPT.OUT with all the error
          information.  This might prove useful if you have a long error
          list.

            The output from SCP_CHK will look something like this:

               Line 3  ALARM  - Error  : too few arguments

            This shows you the line number where the error occurred, the
          function that caused the error, and the reason why it was an
          error.  The error messages are self explanatory.  Simply re-edit
          the script file and correct any errors.  Run SCP_CHK again to
          make sure that you caught all the errors.






          4.0  Script Sample

            This is a sample of a working script file that picks up mail at
          a local BBS.

          Appendix H - Planned Modifications and Upgrades

            At this time I am planning (contingent on the number of
          registrations of MyComm) to make several modifications and
          upgrades to MyComm.  Some of these are:


                 þ  MS-Windows (Tm) and/or Deskview (Tm)
                    compatibility

                 þ  Compuserve-B file transfer protocol

                 þ  KERMIT file transfer protocol

                 þ  VT-200 Terminal Emulation

                 þ  Script Language enhancements

                 þ Command line switches to go directly to dialing
                   directory, to start scripts, to start scripts
                   at a specifed time of day automatically.

                 þ  Simple Host/BBS mode

            Of course upgrades are dependent on you, the end user.  MyComm
          is user supported software.  If I see that people are interested
          in the program, and interested enough to register it, I will feel
          more inclined to continue to perform upgrades to MyComm.

            The creation and development of a program like MyComm is by no
          means trivial.  Continued user support in the form of
          registrations gives me, your humble author, the incentive to keep
          upgrading and improving MyComm.






          Appendix I - MyComm Revision History

          Note: Past versions of this section had every nuance of every
          enhancement or bug fix listed.  I have decided to only list the
          enhancements that pertain to the current major release for
          brevity.

          September 19, 1991  - MyComm Version 1.0 design began
          February 16, 1992   - MyComm Version 1.0 completed
          March 18, 1992      - MyComm Version 1.10 completed
          April 11, 1992      - MyComm Version 1.20 completed
          May 9, 1992         - MyComm Version 1.22 completed
          April 8, 1993       - MyComm Version 2.0 (Major Revision)
          June 19, 1993       - MyComm Version 2.01 (Bug fix)
          July 7, 1993        - MyComm Version 2.02 (Bug fix)
          August 8, 1993      - MyComm Version 2.1 (Enhancement)
          November 11, 1993   - MyComm Version 2.11 (Maintenance release)
          Nov. 93 - Jan 94    - MyComm Versions 2.12 - 2.14
                                were "registered" releases only
          January 3, 1994     - MyComm Version 2.15 (Enhancement)
                                  - Enhanced script language
                                  - Fixed minor bug in Ymodem






          Appendix J - Control Characters

            MyComm supports control characters that are standard with data
          communications.  Control characters are preceded by the caret
          character '^'.  The caret denotes that the next character will be
          a control character.  For example ^M is the symbol for Carriage
          Return or <Enter> which could be used to terminate your "Modem
          Initialization String".  The '^' stands for Ctrl, so sending one
          of these sequences would be similar to pressing the Ctrl key and
          the character 'M' simultaneously.  The control characters are
          especially useful when using the script language functions. For
