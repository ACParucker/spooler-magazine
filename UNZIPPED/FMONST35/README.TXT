* HOW TO INSTALL:

Copy ALL the files in the FMONST35.ZIP archive into a single directory.
Use Program Manager or File Manager to run the program called SETUP.EXE.

If you just want to check out Font Monster, and don't want it littering
little files all over your system, tick the "Check it out" box. If you
later decide you don't want to use Font Monster (hard to imagine, but suit
yourself), all you have to do is delete the directory SETUP.EXE installed
Font Monster in to "uninstall" it.

* SETUP.EXE CAN'T INSTALL

If for some reason SETUP.EXE won't install Font Monster in your computer,
you can use the DOS command, EXPAND, to decompress the files individually.
You must supply the source and destination filenames to EXPAND for all
these files in the FMONST35.ZIP archive:

EXPAND CTL3D.DL_ CTL3D.DLL
EXPAND FMONST.DL_ FMONST.DLL
EXPAND FMONSTER.EX_ FMONSTER.EXE
EXPAND FMONSTER.HL_ FMONSTER.HLP
EXPAND FMONSTER.TX_ FMONSTER.TXT
EXPAND CMDIALOG.VB_ CMDIALOG.VBX
EXPAND MSGBLAST.VB_ MSGBLAST.VBX
EXPAND THREED.VB_ THREED.VBX

Afterward, use Program Manager or File Manager to run FMONSTER.EXE and
start Font Monster.


* FONT MONSTER WON'T RUN, OR LOOKS WIERD WHEN IT RUNS:

Run the SETUP.EXE program again, and this time tick the "Check it out" 
box. This will hopefully overcome the problems you are having with other 
incompatible files on your computer. If you still have no luck, 
double-click on the Font Monster Help file (FMONSTER.HLP). Then press the 
"SEARCH" button and seach for the word "bugs". Here you will find more 
advice about how to make Font Monster run on your system.
