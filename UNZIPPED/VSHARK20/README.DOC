addition to VSHARKS.DOC

* REQUIREMENTS:  This program requires AT or compatible, VGA graphics
  display and 640K system.  SoundBlaster or Adlib card is optional.

* MOUSE :  if you plan to use the mouse, a Microsoft compatible mouse
  driver must be loaded before running VSHARKS.  For best results,  the
  mouse driver should be a recent update,  1991 or later.  If you have
  any problem with the mouse due to compatibility issues just select
  the "POINT : With Keyboard" option from the installation menu.  When
  you are using the mouse, remember that the mouse does not move the
  diver but it simply changes his direction.

* Shareware Version note:  VGA Sharks is an early version of Scubaman's
  Quest.  If you like underwater action games, don't miss the ten
  thrilling episodes in Scubaman's Quest featuring scrolling action,
  a lot of music and sound effects.  Use ORDER.DOC to order your
