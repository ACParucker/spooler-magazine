VGA SHARKS  is an underwater  action arcade  game.  You are a  Scubaman
and your mission is to collect and study rare marine creatures from the
bottom of the sea,  while avoiding your dreadful foes.  Well, it is not
going to be easy.  Of course you are armed  with  your  trusty Stun-gun
that tranquilizes your  enemies for awhile,  and you can always retreat
into your Electrosonic base that repels the sharks, the raybats and the
rest of your rivals.  Your diving uniform is state of the art,  but you
can  survive  only a few shark bites,  and it is  useless  against  the
deadly poison of the Killer-Jelly-fish.

VGA SHARKS  is distributed as Shareware:  if you like the program and
wish to receive the additional ten episodes from the Scubaman's Quest

3.                        GETTING STARTED

To start the program simply type  VSHARKS  <Enter>.

Then the installation  menu will be displayed on the screen. Use the arrow
keys to move the  highlighted  bar to  a menu  entry you  wish to change
and press <Enter>.  Then  select a new item.  Please note  that when using
the keyboard, the "NUM LOCK" key must be OFF.

The installation menu has 5 entries:

1. START THE GAME, gets things  started  when the installation is done.
2. GRAPH : You must specify who is your VGA card manufacturer for this
   program to operate correctly.  If your card is not included
   in this list,  read  file README.DOC for more  information.
3. SOUND : When sound is ON,  you will  be  hearing  music  and sounds
   during the game play.
4. POINT : Activates the  Keyboard,  or the Mouse, or the Joystick. If
   you plan to use the Joystick,  it must be plugged in before
   running  VSHARKS.  Also If you  plan to use  the mouse, the
   mouse driver must be loaded before running VSHARKS.
5. EXIT TO DOS :  Returns you back to the system.

The very first  time you run the program,  and every  time you change a
selection from the installation menu, the program will try to save your
choices in a configuration  file called  VSHARKS.CFG, so next  time you
run the program it will read this file back and  remember what VGA card
you have, if  you want sound to be ON or OFF and what is  your pointing
device preference.  If the current disk is write-protected you will get
a "Write Protect Error Message", simply  unprotect the  disk  and retry.
Press <Enter>  at the START THE GAME option,  now you are ready to play.

After  the installation  is done  you will  see the  opening  screen of
VGA SHARKS.  If the sound is ON, you will hear the opening music theme,
you can either listen to it, or you can press any key  or mouse  button
to start.  Then  the program  will pick one  of the  available games at
random and begin a self-playing demo. It will keep the demo going until
you press a  keyboard key,  or a Mouse button,  or a Joystick button to
start ( depending on what pointing device you are using )

4.                           OPERATION

4.1  ABOUT VGA SHARKS :
You are Scubaman, a noted marine biologist,  and your  mission is to
collect rare marine creatures for study. You swim towards them and when
you are in contact you capture them. Then you must bring them back into
your cage. You receive 10  points for every  creature you capture.  You
must also avoid  contact  with your enemies.  Your  enemies  range from
the easy-going Raybats, to the angry sharks,  to the deadly Jelly-fish.

You can use in self defense your  stun-gun  that  shoots tranquilizers.
Once hit,  your enemy becomes  disoriented and sinks  down  the bottom.
It  remains inactive  for  several  seconds,  until the effect  of  the
tranquilizer  wears off.  If you are in trouble you can  always retreat
in your steal cage.  When inside, you are protected from your enemies.
Also once inside the cage, a sonic  generator will keep the enemies away.

                              Page 2 of 5

As you move  up to higher levels  the effect of the  stun-gun wears off
faster, as your enemies get used to it,  so after they are shot and hit
the bottom, they become active  again in shorter periods of time.  Also
in higher levels, your enemies become more numerous and more aggressive.
Finally remember that your enemies outnumber  you, they are independent,
crafty and smart but you are smarter and faster.

4.2  MENUS

When using the keyboard or the Joystick : At any  time during  the game
press <ESC> to call the main menu,  then use the  arrow keys to move up
or down, press the <SPACEBAR> or the <Enter>  key to select menu items,
or press <ESC> again to skip a selection.  "Num Lock" key  must be OFF.
When using the Mouse:  Click on the right button to call the main menu,

:------------:
:   GAMES    :  VGA SHARKS presently includes 3 games.  Several  other
:------------:  games  will  be  included  in the  next version.

*  RAYBATS    This  is  a  training  session  game,  recommended  for
              children and novice players.  The  raybats are slow but
follow you  closely.  Use this game to  train yourself in  maneuvering
and to practice shooting.  In this game, your cage is moveable.


*  SHARKS    This is a game of  medium  complexity. Your uniform can
             only withstand 50 shark bites, after that you are shark food.
HINTS: Do not fire your stun-gun from far away,  the sharks are smart enough
to see your  shot coming  and avoid it.  Try  to avoid contact with them.
Avoid screen corners, because the sharks will surround.

* KILLER JELLY-FISH  In this game you face the poisonous Killer Jelly-
                  fish,  if they touch  you  once,  you are doomed.
The pace of  this game is purposely slow,  but due to  the fact  that
there are so many Jelly-fish against you the complexity is tremendous.
Since the action is slow this becomes a game of logic that exercsizes
your mind more than your mechanical reflexes.
HINTS:  Try to distract the  jelly-fish away from the marine creature
you are trying to collect, then quickly move around them and pick it up.

----------  joystick  to  move  the Scubaman.  To fire, push any button.

Mouse  :   Move the mouse slightly  towards the  direction  you want to
--------   move.  It might take a little of practice  to  perfect using
the mouse. Always remember that your mouse DOES NOT move the
Scubaman, it  simply  changes  his  direction.  Then the  Frogman  will
maintain this direction.  Click on the  Left button to fire,  Click  on
the Right button to call up the main menu.


4.4  SCORE.

You get 1 score point for  every enemy you shoot down,  10 score points
for  every  marine  creature you  capture  in the  cage.  Once you have
accumulated 100 points,  you move to a more difficult level and you are
given a brand new uniform, so all previous bites are erased.  There are
10 levels total. If you survive all 10 levels you win the game.  On the
bottom left of the screen.  BITE simply counts the number of  bites you
have suffered.  Your uniform can only take 50 Shark bites and finally,
if the poisonous Jelly-fish touches you are doomed.
