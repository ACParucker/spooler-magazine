    A Project/Event Planner 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 (RELEASE.DOC - February 21, 1994)
    =======================================================================
                         Release Notes (Version 2.2)
    =======================================================================
    1.  Fixed a problem with proper resource allocation when the resource's
        calendar has schedules of types "Do Not Repeat", "Every Month", or
        "Every Year".  In these cases, the default schedule was incorrectly
        used after the first day of the special schedule.

    2.  The online help was updated to reflect new registration options.

    =======================================================================
                         Release Notes (Version 2.1)
    =======================================================================
    1.  Fixed a problem when selecting fonts with the "Colors and Fonts"
        option in the "Options" menu.  In the previous version, some
        Windows system resources were not properly released.  This problem
        was not noticeable until many font changes were made and/or until
        the Windows system resources became low.  The memory could then
        only be recovered by restarting Windows.

    2.  When selecting fonts with the "Colors and Fonts" option in the
        "Options" menu, the selected fonts took effect immediately.  This
        has been changed so that if the "Cancel" button is selected in
        the "Colors and Fonts" dialog box, the previous font selection
        would still be used.

                         Release Notes (Version 2.0)
    =======================================================================
    1.  Windows 3.1 is required for this version.

    2.  Added "Colors and Fonts" option to the Options menu to allow font
        and color selection to customize the appearance of the plan.  You
        can now change the planning grid font and background color.  In
        addition you can now select different colors for the event bars.

    3.  Improved the printing of the planning grids so that they more
        closely resemble the screen image in terms of font and color
        selection.

    4.  Added an option to the File menu to invoke the standard Printer Setup
        dialog box.  You can now change the printer or printer options from
        within this program.

    5.  When printing reports, the default font is "Courier New".  If
        you experience problems with the font selection, the ".ini"
        file now includes two new options:
            RptFontFaceName=    Use this to specify the font name.
            RptFontPtSize=      Use this to specify the point size (6-18).

    6.  APLANR now automatically executes the "File - Open" command on
        startup.  An option was also added so that the last opened plan
        can be automatically opened on startup.

    7.  Added unique icons to represent Resource and Calendar documents in
        minimized state.

    8.  Added new accelerator keys for the File menu options:
            Ctrl+N = File - New
            Ctrl+O = File - Open
            Ctrl+S = File - Save
            Ctrl+P = File - Print

    9.  Added a Close option to the File menu to close the currently active
        plan, resource, or calendar document.

    10. Fixed a problem with closing Windows before closing APLANR.  If
        an attempt is made to exit Windows while APLANR is active,
        you will be prompted to save any modified APLANR data before
        Windows exits.

    11. Fixed a problem when entering a partial string that matches
        multiple entries in the Delete/Duplicate/Modify event dialog
        boxes.  APLANR will now remind you that a unique name match
        must occur.

    12. Fixed a problem with data directories located on a different drive
        than where the program executable is located.

    13. Fixed a problem when trying to add more than 32 schedules to
        a calendar.
