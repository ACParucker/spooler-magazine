            SECTION 1.  GENERAL PROGRAM AND AUTHOR INFORMATION.
    =======================================================================
    Dear User:

    This program can be used for quick overall project planning, activity
    scheduling, and resource scheduling.  You can assign income and costs
    to events (tasks) and resources to estimate a project's income and
    cost.  You can define events that are tied to predecessors.  For these
    related events, start and end times are automatically calculated.

    You can shift all events in a plan forward or backward in time.  You
    can define multiple calendars and use different calendars for each
    resource.  The program allows free-form drawing of events on a scale
    of days, weeks, months, or years.  On-line help and sample plans are
    provided.

    It will handle up to a few hundred events in a given plan, but it is
    not suited for highly complex projects where thousands of tasks are
    defined within a project plan.

    This program requires Microsoft Windows 3.1 and a mouse (or equivalent
    pointing device).

    Thank you for trying this program.

            SECTION 5.  DESCRIPTION OF DISTRIBUTED FILES
    ======================================================================
    1.  Informational Files (Not needed for program execution.  These
        are text files that may be viewed by any text editor or word
        processing program):
        file_id.diz  -  Program summary information for BBS.
        readme.doc   -  The file you are reading.
        release.doc  -  Information about the differences between this
                        version and the previous version.
        register.doc -  Registration information.  Information is also
                        provided in the "Registration" option of the
                        program's "Help" menu.
        vendor.doc   -  Information for shareware vendors and BBS SYSOPs.

    2.  Required files for execution (may be placed in separate directory):

        aplanr.hlp   -  On-line Windows help (not in text file format).

        pvidx.dat    -  Plan index file.
        pvrsc.dat    -  Resource definitions file with sample definitions.
        pvyymmdd.sss -  These are plan files that use the following naming
                        convention: yy = year, mm = month, dd = day,
                        sss = sequence number.

    4.  Windows Files:
        aplanr.ini   -  This file is not distributed, but it is a Windows
                        initialization file that is automatically created and
                        maintained.  It is located where Windows keeps its
                        other ".ini" type files.

    ======================================================================
            SECTION 6.  INSTALLATION AND GETTING STARTED
    ======================================================================
    1.  TO UPGRADE FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION, using the standard distribution
        diskette provided directly by Sapphire Software Inc.:

        a.  As a precautionary measure, be sure you make a backup of
            the previous version of the program and data files
            before upgrading.

        b.  Use the DOS copy command or the Windows File Manager to
            replace the old APLANR.EXE (program executable) and APLANR.HLP
            (program help file) with the new versions from the distribution
            diskette.  The new versions use the same filenames.  For example
            if your old files reside in "c:\aplanr", sample commands to
            copy the files are:

                COPY  A:\APLANR.EXE  C:\APLANR
                COPY  A:\APLANR.HLP  C:\APLANR

        c.  If you would like to view the new sample plans, create a
            new directory to hold them.  Then copy the samples from the
            distribution diskette.  For example if "c:\aplanr" holds
            the executable programs, you could create a directory
            "c:\aplanr\samples".  A sample command to copy all the
            sample data from a diskette in drive A is given below:

                COPY  A:\PV*.*  C:\APLANR\SAMPLES
            
            You can then use the "Directories" option of the "Options"
            menu to tell the program to use this directory to access the
            sample data.

            ***DO NOT*** copy the sample plans of the new version into the
            same directory as your current plan files, because the sample
            plan files will over-write yours.

    2.  TO INSTALL A FRESH VERSION from the standard distribution diskette
        provided directly from Sapphire Software Inc.:

        a.  Create a directory to place the program files.  You
            may use the Windows File Manager or DOS.  For example
            in DOS type:

                    MD  C:\APLANR

        b.  Copy all the program files from the diskette to the
            new directory.  You may use the Windows File Manager or
            DOS.  For example in DOS type:

                    COPY  A:\*.*  C:\APLANR

            You do not have to copy all of the files to your disk,
            but the required files are "APLANR.EXE" and "APLANR.HLP".
            These are the program executable and help files respectively.
            (See Item 2 in Section 5.)

    3.  You may execute the program named "APLANR.EXE" directly with the
        Windows File Manager.

        If you want to set up an icon in a program group to execute
        APLANR.EXE, refer to the "Working with Program Items" section
        in the Program Manager chapter of the Windows User's Guide.
            
    4.  Upon starting the program for the first time, review the on-line
        help information that is available from the program's "Help" menu.
        You may print any of the help sections.

    5.  Look at the sample plans, resource definitions, and calendar
        definitions that are provided.

    6.  Refer to the RELEASE.DOC file for additional information regarding
        the current release.

    7.  By default, all data resides in the same directory as the program
        executable.  You may place your data in another location by doing
        the following:

        a.  Create the directory you want to store the data in.
        
        b.  Run APLANR and use the "Directories" option of the "Options"
            menu to tell the program to use this directory for all data.
