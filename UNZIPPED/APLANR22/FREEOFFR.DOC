    A Project/Event Planner 2.2          (FREEOFFR.DOC - February 21, 1994)
    =======================================================================
                        A Free Registration Offer
    =======================================================================
    Dear User:

    I am looking for some "real world" examples of how this program is
    used.  For a limited time (through June, 1994), the registration fee
    for this program will be waived if you send instead a realistic sample
    plan.  This sample plan must have a minimum of 35 events and must
    reflect a real situation.

    The sample plan should be created in a separate directory.  To set
    up a separate directory, first create the new sub-directory
    and then use the "Directories" option of the "Option" menu to set
    the data directory to the new directory.  Blank pvcal.dat (calendars),
    pvidx.dat (index), and pvrsc.dat (resource) files will automatically
    be created.  You can then proceed to set up the sample plan.

    When your sample is completed, copy ALL of the files in the data
    directory to a diskette (3-1/2" or 5-1/4") and mail it to:
        Sapphire Software, Inc.
        6650 Hawaii Kai Drive
        Suite 219
        Honolulu, Hawaii
        USA

    If you have a CompuServe account, you may send the files (preferably
    all in one compressed (ZIPed) file) to 71223,3653.

    Please include a brief description of your sample.  This description
    may be a text file on the diskette or a printed document.

    If you do send a sample plan, you must agree in advance that you
    are sending the sample plan with no restrictions or obligations
    placed upon Sapphire Software Inc.  You must further agree that
    the sample plan or a similar sample plan can be included in future
    releases of this program.

    With this in mind, please do not send any information that you
    consider to be proprietary or confidential.

    I am looking forward to some interesting sample plans.  Thank you and
    Happy Planning !
