           This is a VENDINFO Product Information Record            
                                                                    
 This record is a means of conveying information about a software   
 product from the author to distributors and users.  It contains a  
 normal, "human-readable" section (you're reading it now), followed 
 by a compressed data record.  The data record contains a great     
 deal of information in a form useable by automated tools.  This    
 allows BBSes, disk vendors, etc. to test automatically for         
 permission to distribute, and to automatically extract product     
 information for use in BBS files databases, vendor catalogs, etc.  
                                                                    
 The VENDINFO file standard is published and is freely useable.     
                                                                    
 The VENDINFO toolset includes a free end-user viewer, processing   
 tools for use by distributors (BBSes, shareware disk vendors,      
 etc.), and the editor used by author/publishers to produce these   
 records.  These tools are either free or very-low cost shareware.  
 The toolset can be obtained from many sources, including the       
 originators of VENDINFO:

===== Information for Users ("READ-ME") ================

This package contains Smart Address, verion 1.20, by Oakley Data
Services.  This document contains only a brief description of the
package and its features, along with instructions for its installation.
Quite detailed documentation is included in the package, but it is in
archived form, and is more easily read after installation.

Smart Address is a sophisticated Address Management program for Windows.

Smart Address is a shareware program. You may use Smart Address for up
to 30 days, without charge, to see if it suits your needs. If you like
the Smart Address program, and wish to continue its use after the
evaluation period, you are required to pay for the program.  Any fee you
may have paid to others (disk vendors, dealers, etc.) to obtain the
evaluation versions was a fee for their copying and distribution
services, rather than a payment for continued use of the program.
