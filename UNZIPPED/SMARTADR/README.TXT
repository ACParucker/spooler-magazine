Smart Address is Shareware!

The registration fee for Smart Address, together with an order form, is
available by clicking on the 'Order Form' button on the Help menu. You can
also register by Phone or Fax using VISA or MASTERCARD.

You are entitled to evaluate Smart Address for a period of up to 30 days. If after
that time you intend to continue to use the program you must register it. 
If you do not intend to continue to use the program you must delete it from
your system. 

When you register your copy, the 'reminder screens' will no longer appear,
and you also get support via the phone, by fax, mail or Compuserve, and we 
can keep you up to date with information about enhancements and new and 
complementary products. 

So what is Shareware? 

Shareware is copyrighted software which is distributed by authors through
bulletin boards, on-line services, disk vendors, and by copies being
passed among friends. It is commercial software that you are allowed to try
before you pay for it. This makes shareware the ultimate in money back
guarantees.

Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software.
There is good and bad shareware, just as there is good and bad retail
software. The primary difference between shareware and retail software
is that with shareware you know if it's good or bad before you pay for it.

You benefit because you get to use the software to determine whether it
meets your needs, before you pay for it.  Authors benefit because they are
able to get their products into your hands without the expenses it takes
to launch a traditional retail software product.

The shareware system and the continued availability of quality shareware 
products depend on your willingness to register and pay for the shareware
you use. It is the registration fees you pay which allow us to support and
continue to develop our products. Please show your support for shareware by
registering those programs you actually use and by passing them on to
others. Shareware is kept alive by your support!
