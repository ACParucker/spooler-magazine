INSTALLATION NOTES

Once you have unarchived (or copied) all of Plug-In's files to a
directory on your hard disk (e.g., C:\PLUGIN), run PLUGIN.EXE from 
Windows.  Plug-In has a built-in install program which will copy
a few small files to the Windows directory and create the 
initialization file. 

Keep in mind that Plug-In is fully integrated with Program Manager. 
To access Plug-In, you use Program Manager's menus!

Once installed, you should refer to:

        - The Quick Tour section in Plug-In's on-line Help.
        - Configure Plug-In (Options menu in Program Manager).

That's all there is to it!  We hope you enjoy the program.  The trial
license for Plug-In allows you to use it for a period of 21 days,
after which time you must register it if you continue using it. 
When you receive your registration number, simply enter it in the 
"Enter Registration Number" dialog.


USER'S GUIDE IN ON-LINE HELP

Plug-In contains a complete User's Guide in its on-line help system.
You can select the "Help" button (or press F1) in all dialogs to go
directly to specific help for that dialog.


UPDATING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF PLUG-IN

NOTE:  The following will retain your current configuration for Plug-In.

1) Shutdown Plug-In by pushing the "Remove Plug-In (Shutdown)"
   button in the "Configure Plug-In" dialog (Options menu in ProgMan).

2) UnArchive the most recent version of Plug-In into the SAME
   directory currently used for Plug-In (e.g., C:\PLUGIN).
   It is OK to overwrite the existing files in this directory.

3) COPY GROUP.EXE to your Windows directory (Please don't forget
   to do this!).

4) You are now updated!  Simply run PLUGIN.EXE to continue.  


INTERNATIONAL ISSUES

Plug-In will operate under international versions of Windows.  
However, there is one thing you must do for proper operation 
if you are using Windows 3.1:  Edit (using NotePad) ProgMan.INI and
define your StartUp group under the [Settings] section 
(e.g., "StartUp=Autostart").

We are planning fully internationalized versions of Plug-In
for a future release.  Contact us for more details.


SOME DETAILS ABOUT THE INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

If you get a message saying that, "Plug-In is being installed from a 
location that may not be available during later Windows sessions," 
this means that Plug-In is being installed from either a removable
drive (i.e., a floppy drive) or a remote drive (i.e., a network drive).
Plug-In sets up its initialization file to point to the location
from which it was installed.  Because of this, you should not install
Plug-In from a floppy drive.  However, it is fine to install from
a network drive as long as it is always available from within Windows.

The "Save Settings On Exit" option in Program Manager is turned
off during the installation (you can still save on exit if you wish).
We recommend that you use "Save Settings Now" instead.  Please refer
to the on-line help for further details.

Plug-In sets itself up to load each time Windows is started.  This 
is the best way to get optimal use out of the program.  If you decide
that you don't want to continue using Plug-In, simply disable the 
"Run Plug-In when Windows starts" option in the configuration dialog.

Plug-In places 5 files in your Windows directory.  These are:

        GROUP.EXE
        PLUGINQN.PIF
        PLUGINQN.BAT
        PLUGINQM.PIF
        PLUGINQM.BAT

These files only take up about 7K bytes.  They are placed in the
Windows directory because they need to be in a directory listed 
in the PATH environment variable.  If you do not wish to have
these files in your Windows directory, it is acceptable to place
them elsewhere, as long as they are on your path (e.g., you could
leave them in the directory with the rest of the Plug-In files if
you added this directory to your PATH environment variable.)

(Note that two other very small files, PLUGIN.INI and PLUGIN.HST,
are created and maintained in the Windows directory).


INSTALLING FROM A CD-ROM DRIVE

If you are installing Plug-In from a CD-ROM drive, you must first
copy all the files to a directory on your hard disk (e.g, C:\PLUGIN).
Then, run PLUGIN.EXE from the directory on your hard disk.


OBTAINING THE MOST UP-TO-DATE VERSION OF PLUG-IN

If, for whatever reason, you want to be SURE that you have the 
absolute latest version of Plug-In, you may contact Plannet Crafters
directly.  We will ship you the latest version for a nominal charge
of:
        $5 (including shipping / handling in the U.S. and Canada)
        $8 (including shipping / handling for International orders)

Or, you may obtain the latest version directly from the Plannet Crafters BBS


THE PLANNET CRAFTERS BBS 

Our BBS contains the latest version of Plug-In as well as other products 
from Plannet Crafters.  

It is available 24 hours / day, and supports baud rates up to 14.4 KBPS.  
The number is (404) 740-8583.  


KEEPING BACKUPS OF PLUG-IN'S DATA FILES

It is always a good idea to backup your data files!  Most of Plug-In's
configuration data is kept in one file, PLUGIN.INI, which resides in
the Windows directory.  Another file, PLUGIN.HST (also in the Windows
directory) maintains the history list for the run command.  Both of
these files are small, and a simple backup procedure is to copy them
to a floppy disk on occasion.

While on the topic of backups, you might also wish to keep backups of
your group files.  Simply copy *.GRP (the group files) and *.G_P (the
deactivated group files) from your Windows directory to a floppy disk.


USING MICROSOFT'S MS-MOUSE UTILITY (8.10 or 8.20)

If you wish to use this utility and also want to make use of 
Plug-In's custom cursors, you must not use the "growth" feature
in the MS-MOUSE utility.  For more details, refer to the on-line Help.


NOTE TO WINDOWS 3.0 USERS

There are a few commands (some of the group functions and tile 
horizontal) that are only available under Windows 3.1.  The
unavailable commands will be grayed out (disabled) in the menus.

Plug-In requires two DLL files which are a part of the Windows 3.1
retail package.  These files are COMMDLG.DLL and TOOLHELP.DLL.  If
you don't have access to these files, you may contact Plannet Crafters
and we will help you obtain them.

Please be sure that you have the current versions of these DLL files
on your system.  If either of these DLL's is dated earlier than
March 10, 1992, you should try to obtain more current versions.


HOW TO DE-INSTALL PLUG-IN

If you wish to de-install Plug-In from a system, do the following:

        1) Disable "Run Plug-In when Windows starts" in the Config
           dialog and press the OK button.  (If you fail to do this, 
           you must manually remove the Plug-In entry from either 
           the StartUp group or the "Load=" line in the WIN.INI file.)  
        2) Shutdown Plug-In by selecting "Remove Plug-In" in the 
           Config dialog.
        3) In the Windows directory, Delete the following files:
           PLUGINQ?.*, PLUGIN.INI, PLUGIN.HST, GROUP.EXE
        4) Delete all files in Plug-In's home directory (assuming
           this directory contains ONLY Plug-In files!)



CHANGE HISTORY

1.00    - Initial Release

1.01    - Keep the registration screen on top until it is dealt with.
        - Minor documentation changes
        - Display message if "Group Copy" to an existing group
        - Added "SWITCH" option to GROUP.EXE utility
        - Fixed a minor problem with parentheses in group/item names
        - The external Group utility wasn't updating customized group
          icons when a group was activated.

1.10    - Change to 1.10 so that we can rename PLUGIN10.ZIP to PLUGIN11.ZIP
          This was necessary because many BBS's, etc. won't update a file
          with the same name.
        - Fixed a problem where Plug-In would claim it was being installed
          from a floppy drive when in fact it was not.
        - Increased the max number of QuickRun entries to 25 and the
          max number of SpeedList entries to 20.
        - Minor documentation changes.

1.11    - Fixed a bug that caused a GP Fault when an application sent
          a broadcast notification of multiple changes to WIN.INI.  
          The only known example of this is selecting a different printer 
          from within the Page Setup dialog in Excel 4.0.
        - Miscellaneous changes to the README.DOC file.

1.12    
        - Fixed a couple of problems relating to bugs in several
          256-color drivers on the market.  Since we couldn't fix
          the drivers, we modified the code to work around the problems.
          Note that one of these workarounds was to avoid compressing
          the large bitmaps in Plug-In.  This is why the PLUGIN.EXE file
          is significantly larger than previous versions.
        - Fixed a couple of minor grammatical errors in dialog text.
        - Fixed a problem where the highlited icon in the change icon
          dialog had a black background when it shouldn't  This only
          occured with certain combinations of system colors.
        - In the on-line help, added a jump to the Config topic from
          the QuickRun topic.
        - Fixed a problem involving load orders when more than one
          ProgMan enhancement utility was used on the same system.

1.20
        - Plug-In no longer assumes that a StartUp group is defined.
          If a StartUp group isn't present, Plug-In will be auto-loaded
          via WIN.INI settings
        - Blank entries inserted in the QuickRun menu now show up in
          the Configure QuickRun dialog so they can be deleted.
        - Some utilities that add an icon (or something else) to the
          title bar of the active application do not realize that Plug-In
          has attached itself to Program Manager.  This would cause
          Plug-In to become semi-detached when these utilities switched
          from Program Manager to another active application.  Plug-In
          now attaches itself to Program Manager in a way that avoids
          these problems.
        - If a laptop (or other computer) was started without a mouse,
          a problem could occur when Plug-In tried to load its custom
          cursors.  This has been fixed.
        - Made some modifications to the Registration Dialogs.
        - We are no longer distributing COMMDLG.DLL and TOOLHELP.DLL
          with the shareware version of Plug-In.  If you are running
          Windows 3.0 and don't have these files, please contact
          Plannet Crafters.

1.21    - Fixed a problem where the highlited icon in the change icon
          dialog had a black background when it shouldn't  This only
          occured with certain combinations of system colors.  (Note:
          This problem was supposed to have been fixed in v1.12, but
          was accidentally left out...).

1.30    - One of the fixes in v1.20 caused ProgMan to be unresponsive
          if "Minimize On Use" was set in ProgMan's Options menu.
          Even though the majority of users do not set the "Minimize
          on Use" option for ProgMan, this problem was deemed serious
          enough to justify a new minor release number.

        - Modified the default configuration for the QuickRun menu.

        - Added a topic in help on how to contact Plannet Crafters.
