---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Distribution Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Individuals, Computer Clubs and User Groups who wish to distribute
the Plug-In package to friends or associates may do so in accordance with 
the restrictions outlined in this documentation.

Limited Distribution License:
-----------------------------

As the exclusive copyright holder for Plug-In, Plannet Crafters, Inc. 
authorizes distribution only in accordance with the following restrictions.

*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*
* ASP Approved Vendors in good standing are hereby given permission to      
* distribute the Plug-In package.  Non-ASP member vendors 
* must request prior permission before distributing the Plug-In package.                           
*                                                                           
* Plannet Crafters, Inc. also hereby grants permission to distribute the
* Plug-In package to Individuals, User Groups, Computer Clubs and BBS's 
* as long as distribution is in accordance with the following restrictions. 
*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*

The Plug-In package is defined as containing all the material listed in 
the PACKING.LST text file.  If any files listed in the PACKING.LST text 
file, or the PACKING.LST file itself, are missing, then the package is 
not complete and distribution is forbidden.  Please contact us to obtain 
a complete package suitable for distribution.

The Plug-In package - including all related program files and documentation
files - CANNOT be modified in any way and must be distributed as a complete
package, with the only exception explained in the next paragraph.  The
PACKING.LST text file contains a list of all files that are part of
the Plug-In package.

There is one exception to the above paragraph.  Many BBS's customarily 
add a small text file (advertisement) to each archived file.  This text 
file describes the BBS and tells people that the file was downloaded from 
that particular BBS.  Other BBSs add a  small one-line message with 
their BBS name and phone number into the compressed file, which will 
display when the file is uncompressed.  Either of these methods of
mentioning your BBS are acceptable and may be used, provided the program
and documentation is otherwise unmodified and complete.

No price or other compensation may be charged for the Plug-In package.
A distribution fee may be charged for the cost of the diskette, shipping
and handling, as long as the total (per disk) does not exceed
US$8.00 (U.S / Canada) or 12.00 (International).


Disk Sets & CD-ROMs:
--------------------

The Plug-In package CANNOT be sold as part of some other inclusive package.  
Nor can it be included in any commercial software packaging offer, without
a written agreement from Plannet Crafters, Inc.

ASP Approved Vendors who wish to distribute the Plug-In package as part
of a collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk set, or a CD-ROM package) may do 
so provided that all the other restrictions are met.

Vendors (non-ASP Vendor Members) who wish to distribute the Plug-In
package as part of a collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk set, or a CD-ROM 
package) must obtain permission from Plannet Crafters, Inc. prior 
to beginning such a distribution.

If you wish to add any of our programs to a CD-ROM or other collection,
please check the release date of the version you have.  If the version
is over six (6) months old then please contact us to ensure that you
have the most current version.  This version was released in February 1993.


Disk-of-the-Month (or Subscription) Distribution:
-------------------------------------------------

If you would like to distribute the Plug-In package as a Disk-of-the-Month,
or as part of a subscription or monthly service, then the following 
restrictions apply:

ASP Associate (Disk Vendor) Members in good standing are hereby given
permission to distribute the Plug-In package under the Disk-of-the-Month
style of distribution.

Others (non-ASP Members) must contact us in advance to ensure that you
have the most current version of the software.

You cannot use a Disk-of-the-Month distribution to use up your inventory
of old (out of date) disks.  Only current versions may be shipped as
Disk-of-the-Month disks.

The Plug-In package cannot be "rented" or "leased" to others.

You may not list any of our products in advertisements, catalogs, or
other literature which describes our products as "FREE SOFTWARE".
Shareware is "Try-Before-You-Buy" software, it is not free.

Plannet Crafters, Inc. prohibits the distribution of outdated
versions of the Plug-In package, without written permission from 
Plannet Crafters, Inc.  If the version you have is over six (6) months old,
please contact us to ensure that you have the most current version. 
This version was released in February 1993.

Licensee shall not use, copy, rent, lease, sell, modify, decompile,
disassemble, otherwise reverse engineer, or transfer the licensed
program except as provided in this agreement.  Any such unauthorized use
shall result in immediate and automatic termination of this license.

U.S. Government Information:  Use, duplication, or disclosure by the
U.S. Government of the computer software and documentation in this
package shall be subject to the restricted rights applicable to
commercial computer software as set forth in subdivision (b)(3)(ii) of
